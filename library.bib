@article{Yeh2010,
abstract = {A cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) control system, which contains only one single-input controller implemented by a differentiable CMAC, is proposed in this paper. In the proposed scheme, the CMAC controller is solely used to control the plant, and no conventional controller is needed. Without a preliminary offline learning, the single-input CMAC controller can provide the control effort to the plant at each online learning step. To train the differentiable CMAC online, the gradient descent algorithm is employed to derive the learning rules. The sensitivity of the plant, with respect to the input, is approximated by a simple formula so that the learning rules can be applied to unknown plants. Moreover, based on a discrete-type Lyapunov function, conditions on the learning rates guaranteeing the convergence of the output error are derived in this paper. Finally, simulations on controlling three different plants are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

@misc{Albus1971,
abstract = {A comprehensive theory of cerebellar function is presented, which ties together the known anatomy and physiology of the cerebellum into a pattern-recognition data processing system. The cerebellum is postulated to be functionally and structurally equivalent to a modification of the classical Perceptron pattern-classification device. It is suggested that the mossy fiber → granule cell → Golgi cell input network performs an expansion recoding that enhances the pattern-discrimination capacity and learning speed of the cerebellar Purkinje response cells. Parallel fiber synapses of the dendritic spines of Purkinje cells, basket cells, and stellate cells are all postulated to be specifically variable in response to climbing fiber activity. It is argued that this variability is the mechanism of pattern storage. It is demonstrated that, in order for the learning process to be stable, pattern storage must be accomplished principally by weakening synaptic weights rather than by strengthening them.},

abstract = {Vision has extensively expanded robots' capabilities, making the
robot control problem more complex. To track a target with a robot arm
in a three-dimensional space involves the use of precise commands. We
propose to insert a hierarchical neurocontroller based on CMAC
(cerebellar model articulation controller) networks in a visual servoing
loop. This hierarchical structure splits the robot's workspace and
assigns different CMAC controllers imposing thus a specialized region
CMAC. Compared to a single CMAC with the same number of weights, the
neurocontroller's sensitivity and precision is increased. Robot
positioning and target tracking with visual feedback can then be done
with a better precision},

@article{Teddy2007,
abstract = {The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network (NN) is a well-established computational model of the human cerebellum. Nevertheless, there are two major drawbacks associated with the uniform quantization scheme of the CMAC network. They are the following: (1) a constant output resolution associated with the entire input space and (2) the generalization-accuracy dilemma. Moreover, the size of the CMAC network is an exponential function of the number of inputs. Depending on the characteristics of the training data, only a small percentage of the entire set of CMAC memory cells is utilized. Therefore, the efficient utilization of the CMAC memory is a crucial issue. One approach is to quantize the input space nonuniformly. For existing nonuniformly quantized CMAC systems, there is a tradeoff between memory efficiency and computational complexity. Inspired by the underlying organizational mechanism of the human brain, this paper presents a novel CMAC architecture named hierarchically clustered adaptive quantization CMAC (HCAQ-CMAC). HCAQ-CMAC employs hierarchical clustering for the nonuniform quantization of the input space to identify significant input segments and subsequently allocating more memory cells to these regions. The stability of the HCAQ-CMAC network is theoretically guaranteed by the proof of its learning convergence. The performance of the proposed network is subsequently benchmarked against the original CMAC network, as well as two other existing CMAC variants on two real-life applications, namely, automated control of car maneuver and modeling of the human blood glucose dynamics. The experimental results have demonstrated that the HCAQ-CMAC network offers an efficient memory allocation scheme and improves the generalization and accuracy of the network output to achieve better or comparable performances with smaller memory usages. Index Terms-Cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC), hierarchical clustering, hierarchically clustered adaptive quantization CMAC (HCAQ-CMAC), learning convergence, nonuniform quantization.},

@article{Schwartz2008,
abstract = {This article describes a new multivariate measure of overall gait pathology called the Gait Deviation Index (GDI). The first step in developing the GDI was to use kinematic data from a large number of walking strides to derive a set of mutually independent joint rotation patterns that efficiently describe gait. These patterns are called gait features. Linear combinations of the first 15 gait features produced a 98{\%} faithful reconstruction of both the data from which they were derived and 1000 validation strides not used in the derivation. The GDI was then defined as a scaled distance between the 15 gait feature scores for a subject and the average of the same 15 gait feature scores for a control group of typically developing (TD) children. Concurrent and face validity data for the GDI are presented through comparisons with the Gillette Gait Index (GGI), Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire Walking Scale (FAQ), and topographic classifications within the diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy (CP). The GDI and GGI are strongly correlated (r(2)=0.56). The GDI scales with FAQ level, distinguishes levels from one another, and is normally distributed across FAQ levels six to ten and among TD children. The GDI also scales with respect to clinical involvement based on topographic CP classification in Hemiplegia Types I-IV, Diplegia, Triplegia and Quadriplegia. The GDI offers an alternative to the GGI as a comprehensive quantitative gait pathology index, and can be readily computed using the electronic addendum provided with this article.},

abstract = {A comprehensive theory of cerebellar function is presented, which ties together the known anatomy and physiology of the cerebellum into a pattern-recognition data processing system. The cerebellum is postulated to be functionally and structurally equivalent to a modification of the classical Perceptron pattern-classification device. It is suggested that the mossy fiber → granule cell → Golgi cell input network performs an expansion recoding that enhances the pattern-discrimination capacity and learning speed of the cerebellar Purkinje response cells. Parallel fiber synapses of the dendritic spines of Purkinje cells, basket cells, and stellate cells are all postulated to be specifically variable in response to climbing fiber activity. It is argued that this variability is the mechanism of pattern storage. It is demonstrated that, in order for the learning process to be stable, pattern storage must be accomplished principally by weakening synaptic weights rather than by strengthening them.},

@article{Xu2013,
abstract = {Estimation of on-off timing of human skeletal muscles during movement is an ongoing issue in surface electromyography (sEMG) signal processing for relevant clinical applications. Widely used single threshold methods still rely on the experience of the operator to manually establish a threshold level. In this paper, a novel approach to address this issue is presented. Based on the generalized likelihood ratio test, the maximum likelihood (ML) method is improved with an adaptive threshold technique based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimate in the initial time before accurate sEMG analyses. The dependence of optimal threshold on SNR is determined by minimizing the onset/offset estimate error on a large set of simulated signals with well-known signal parameters. Accuracy and precision of the algorithm were assessed by using a set of simulated signals and real sEMG signals recorded from two healthy subjects during elbow flexion-extension movements with and without workload. Comparison with traditional algorithms shows that with a moderate increase in the computational effort the ML algorithm performs well even for low levels of EMG activity, while the proposed adaptive method is most robust with respect to variations in SNRs. Also, we discuss the results of analyzing the sEMG recordings from the selected proximal muscles of the upper limb in two hemiparetic subjects. The detection algorithm is automatic and user-independent, managing the detection of both onset and offset activation, and is applicable in presence of noise allowing use by skilled and unskilled operators alike.},

@article{Yeung2012,
abstract = {Trans-tibial amputees are advised to walk as much as able people to achieve healthy and independent life. However, they usually have difficulties in doing so. Previous researches only included data from a few steps when studying the gait of amputees. Walking over a long distance was rarely examined. The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in spatial-temporal, kinetic and kinematic gait parameters of trans-tibial amputees after long-distance walking. Six male unilateral trans-tibial amputees performed two sessions of 30-min walking on a level treadmill at their self-selected comfortable speed. Gait analysis was undertaken over-ground: (1) before walking, (2) after the 1st walking session and (3) after the 2nd walking session. After the long-distance walking, changes in spatial-temporal gait parameters were small and insignificant. However, the sound side ankle rocker progression and push-off were significantly reduced. This was due to the fatigue of the sound side plantar flexors and was compensated by the greater effort in the prosthetic side. The prosthetic side knee joint showed significantly increased flexion and moment during loading response to facilitate the anterior rotation of the prosthetic shank. The prosthetic side hip extensors also provided more power at terminal stance to facilitate propulsion. Endurance training of the sound side plantar flexors, and improvements in the prosthetic design to assist anterior rotation of the prosthetic shank should improve long-distance walking in trans-tibial amputees.},

abstract = {A comprehensive theory of cerebellar function is presented, which ties together the known anatomy and physiology of the cerebellum into a pattern-recognition data processing system. The cerebellum is postulated to be functionally and structurally equivalent to a modification of the classical Perceptron pattern-classification device. It is suggested that the mossy fiber → granule cell → Golgi cell input network performs an expansion recoding that enhances the pattern-discrimination capacity and learning speed of the cerebellar Purkinje response cells. Parallel fiber synapses of the dendritic spines of Purkinje cells, basket cells, and stellate cells are all postulated to be specifically variable in response to climbing fiber activity. It is argued that this variability is the mechanism of pattern storage. It is demonstrated that, in order for the learning process to be stable, pattern storage must be accomplished principally by weakening synaptic weights rather than by strengthening them.},

abstract = {The prosthetic foot plays an important role in propelling, breaking, balancing and supporting body loads while the amputee ambulates on different grounds. It is therefore important to quantify the effect of the prosthetic foot mechanism on biomechanical parameters, in order to prevent pressure ulcers and deep tissue injury. Our aim was to monitor the internal stresses in the residuum of transtibial amputation (TTA) prosthetic-users ambulating on different terrains, which the amputees encounter during their daily activities, i.e. paved floor, grass, ascending and descending stairs and slope. We specifically aimed to compare between the internal stresses in the TTA residuum of amputees ambulating with a novel hydraulic prosthetic foot compared to conventional energy storage and return (ESR) prosthetic feet. Monitoring of internal stresses was accomplished using a portable subject-specific real-time internal stress monitor. We found significant decrease (p<0.01) in peak internal stresses and in the loading rate of the amputated limb, while walking with the hydraulic foot, compared to walking with ESR feet. The loading rate calculated while ambulating with the hydraulic foot was at least three times lower than the loading rate calculated while ambulating with the ESR foot. Although the average decrease in internal stresses was ≈ 2-fold larger when replacing single-toe ESR feet with the hydraulic foot than when replacing split-toed ESR feet with the hydraulic foot, the differences were statistically insignificant. Our findings suggest that using a hydraulic prosthetic foot may protect the distal tibial end of the TTA residuum from high stresses, therefore preventing pressure-related injury and pain.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the application of quadratic
optimization for motion control to feedback control of robotic systems
using cerebellar model arithmetic computer (CMAC) neural networks.
Explicit solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (H-J-B) equation for
optimal control of robotic systems are found by solving an algebraic
Riccati equation. It is shown how the CMAC can cope with nonlinearities
through optimization with no preliminary off-line learning phase
required. The adaptive-learning algorithm is derived from Lyapunov
stability analysis, so that both system-tracking stability and error
convergence can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system. The
filtered-tracking error or critic gain and the Lyapunov function for the
nonlinear analysis are derived from the user input in terms of a
specified quadratic-performance index. Simulation results from a
two-link robot manipulator show the satisfactory performance of the
proposed control schemes even in the presence of large modeling
uncertainties and external disturbances},

abstract = {The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network is capable of learning nonlinear functions extremely quickly due to the local nature of its weight updating. The rectangular shape of CMAC receptive field functions, however, produces discontinuous (staircase) function approximations without inherent analytical derivatives. The ability to learn both functions and function derivatives is important for the development of many online adaptive filter, estimation, and control algorithms. It is shown that use of B-spline receptive field functions in conjunction with more general CMAC weight addressing schemes allows higher-order CMAC neural networks to be developed that can learn both functions and function derivatives. This also allows hierarchical and multilayer CMAC network architectures to be constructed that can be trained using standard error back-propagation learning techniques.},

abstract = {This paper describes the recognition method and the control method to realize the power assist which reflects operator's intention by grasping the interaction between operator's intention and motion information. The basic control method for HAL had been performed by using myoelectricity which reflects operator's intention. As the application of the basic method, we considered the control method of power assist based on another information by considering the relation between myoelectricity and another information of motion, and the recognition method for the control method. We adopted phase sequence control which generated a series of assist motions by the transition of some fundamental motions called phase. The result of experiments showed the effective power assist which reflected operator's intention by using this control method.},

@article{Schutte2000,
abstract = {A method is derived to calculate the amount by which a subject's gait deviates from an average normal profile, and to represent this deviation as a single number. The method uses principal component analysis to derive a set of 16 independent variables from 16 selected gait variables. The sum of the square of these 16 independent variables is interpreted as the deviation of the subject's gait from normal. Statistical tests of the method's validity and an initial demonstration of its clinical utility are included. It is found that using this index, increasing clinical involvement corresponds to increasing index score.},

@article{Kark2012a,
abstract = {Gait summary measures have been developed as a convenient method to communicate overall gait pathology. These measures are primarily used in the context of paediatric cerebral palsy and their use remains largely untested in other disability groups. This study assessed the suitability of gait summary measures for use with lower limb amputees. Modified (m) versions of three published gait summary measures were investigated - the Gillette Gait Index (mGGI), the Gait Deviation Index (mGDI) and the Gait Profile Score (mGPS) in conjunction with the Movement Analysis Profile (MAP). Twenty unilateral lower limb amputees underwent three-dimensional gait analysis. All measures reported significant differences between levels of amputation on the prosthetic limb. The mGGI and mGPS detected significant differences between the levels of amputation on the intact side, but the mGDI did not. All gait summary measures were moderately to strongly correlated with leg-length normalised self-selected walking speed and strong correlations were reported between all measures. The MAP exposed common strategies in amputee gait and showed that sagittal hip and knee kinematics contributed predominantly to overall gait deviation in this population group. The mGGI, mGDI and mGPS identified, quantified and stratified gait pathology, indicating that any of the gait measures investigated in this study can be applied as outcome measures in research and case management in lower limb amputees.},

@article{Turcot2012,
abstract = {This study investigated the full-body strategies utilized during a sit-to-stand (STS) task in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and the association between STS alterations and clinical measurements. Twenty-five patients with advanced knee OA and twenty healthy elderly adults were recruited to participate in this study. Patients were asked to stand up from a chair four times without using their arms. A 3D motion analysis system was used to capture the full-body kinematics during the task. Two force plates were used to capture the forces under each leg. The following parameters were investigated in the knee OA group and compared with the control group: the time to realize STS, the force ratio between both limbs, the knee and hip kinetics and the trunk kinematics. The pain and functional capacity were obtained from the WOMAC. The results showed that patients with knee OA put 10{\%} additional weight on the contralateral side when compared with the symmetrical strategy of the control group. Patients with knee OA showed a significantly lower knee flexion moment (0.51 Nm/kg vs. 0.72 Nm/kg), a higher maximal trunk flexion (46.4° vs. 37.5°), and a higher lateral trunk lean on the contralateral side (2.4° vs. 0.9°) when compared with the control group. The main correlations were found between pain and the averaged time to complete the STS task (r=0.55). With the quantification of the full-body mechanisms utilized during the STS task, which includes both distal and proximal compensations, our study brings new insights, leading to a better understanding of the functional alterations in patients with advanced knee OA.},

@article{Ioannidis2007,
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

@article{Leurs2012,
abstract = {In order to achieve efficacious walking, transfemoral amputees must adapt coordination within both the artificial and the sound lower limb. We analyzed kinematic strategies in amputees using the planar covariation of lower limb segments approach. When the elevation angles of the thigh, shank and foot are plotted one versus the others, they describe a regular loop which lies close to a plane in normal adults' gait. Orientation of this plane changes with increased speed, in relation to mechanical energetic saving. We used an opto-electronic device to record the elevation angles of both limbs' segments of novice and expert transfemoral amputees and compared them to those of control subjects. The statistical structure underlying the distribution of these angles was described by principal component analysis and Fourier transform. The typical elliptic loop was preserved in prosthetic walking, in both limbs in both novice and expert transfemoral amputees. This reflects a specific control over the thigh elevation angle taking into account knowledge of the other elevation angles throughout the gait cycle. The best-fitting plane of faster trials rotates around the long axis of the gait loop with respect to the plane of slower trials for control subjects, and even more for the sound limb of expert amputees. In contrast, plane rotation is very weak or absent for the prosthetic limb. We suggest that these results reveal a centrally commanded compensation strategy.},

@article{Baker2009,
abstract = {The Gait Deviation Index (GDI) has been proposed as an index of overall gait pathology. This study proposes an interpretation of the difference measure upon which the GDI is based, which naturally leads to the definition of a similar index, the Gait Profile Score (GPS). The GPS can be calculated independently of the feature analysis upon which the GDI is based. Understanding what the underlying difference measure represents also suggests that reporting a raw score, as the GPS does, may have advantages over the logarithmic transformation and z-scaling incorporated in the GDI. It also leads to the concept of a Movement Analysis Profile (MAP) to summarise much of the information contained within kinematic data. A validation study on all children attending a paediatric gait analysis service over 3 years (407 children) provides evidence to support the use of the GPS through analysis of its frequency distribution across different Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) categories, investigation of intra-session variability, and correlation with the square root of GGI. Correlation with GDI confirms the strong relationship between the two measures. The study concludes that GDI and GPS are alternative and closely related measures. The GDI has prior art and is particularly useful in applications arising out of feature analysis such as cluster analysis or subject matching. The GPS will be easier to calculate for new models where a large reference dataset is not available and in association with applications using the MAP.},

abstract = {This study proposes an islanding detection method for photovoltaic power generation systems based on a cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network. First, islanding phenomenon test data were used as training samples to train the CMAC neural network. Then, a photovoltaic power generation system was tested with the islanding phenomena. Because the CMAC neural network possesses association and induction abilities and characteristics that activate similar input signals in approximate memory during training process, the CMAC only requires that the weight values of the excited memory addresses be adjusted, thereby reducing the training time. Furthermore, quantification of the input signals enhanced the detection tolerance of the proposed method. Finally, the simulative and experimental data verified the feasibility of adopting the proposed detection method for islanding phenomena.},

@article{Highsmith2011,
abstract = {Transitional movements are a determinant of functional independence and have limited study in amputees. Microprocessor prosthetic knees' abilities to assist transfemoral amputees with sitting and standing have not been studied. Through cross-sectional study, 21 transfemoral amputees, divided into 3 groups of 7 by knee type (power knee, C-leg, Mauch SNS) and 7 non-amputee controls (n=28) performed sit to stand and stand to sit while kinematic and kinetic data were recorded. Transfemoral amputees can stand (1.6-2.0s) and sit (2.1-2.8s) at rates comparable to controls (1.6s). Controls' ground reaction force (GRF) and knee moment production was <7{\%} asymmetric and superior to amputees' during both movements. For sit to stand, amputees' asymmetry for GRF ranged from 53 to 69{\%} and 110 to 124{\%} for knee moments. For stand to sit, amputees' asymmetry for GRF ranged from 32 to 60{\%} and 84 to 114{\%} for knee moments. Hip moment asymmetry for sit to stand was less for control (21{\%}) and power knee (34{\%}) groups than that produced by the Mauch SNS (59{\%}) group. For stand to sit, hip moment production for the Mauch SNS (47{\%}) and C-leg groups (71{\%}) were more asymmetric than controls (19{\%}). In the majority of cases transfemoral amputees do not load their prosthesis extensively for standing up or sitting down. Therefore, this transitional movement is currently a one-legged task, which increases stress on the sound limb. Generally, the prosthetic knees studied did not produce a significant knee moment in either task. Although most differences between knee groups were not statistically significant, differences may be clinically meaningful on an individual basis.},

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

abstract = {Gait summary measures have been developed as a convenient method to communicate overall gait pathology. These measures are primarily used in the context of paediatric cerebral palsy and their use remains largely untested in other disability groups. This study assessed the suitability of gait summary measures for use with lower limb amputees. Modified (m) versions of three published gait summary measures were investigated - the Gillette Gait Index (mGGI), the Gait Deviation Index (mGDI) and the Gait Profile Score (mGPS) in conjunction with the Movement Analysis Profile (MAP). Twenty unilateral lower limb amputees underwent three-dimensional gait analysis. All measures reported significant differences between levels of amputation on the prosthetic limb. The mGGI and mGPS detected significant differences between the levels of amputation on the intact side, but the mGDI did not. All gait summary measures were moderately to strongly correlated with leg-length normalised self-selected walking speed and strong correlations were reported between all measures. The MAP exposed common strategies in amputee gait and showed that sagittal hip and knee kinematics contributed predominantly to overall gait deviation in this population group. The mGGI, mGDI and mGPS identified, quantified and stratified gait pathology, indicating that any of the gait measures investigated in this study can be applied as outcome measures in research and case management in lower limb amputees.},

Then, adaptation laws for the neural network weights are derived. Asymptotic convergence of the position and velocity tracking errors is proven, while the neural network weights are shown to be uniformly bounded. The proposed scheme has been experimentally validated in real time. These experimental evaluations were carried in two different mechanical systems: a horizontal two degrees-of-freedom robot and a vertical one degree-of-freedom arm which is affected by the gravitational force. In each one of the two experimental set-ups, the proposed scheme was implemented without and with adaptive neural network compensation. Experimental results confirmed the tracking accuracy of the proposed adaptive neural network-based controller.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate lower extremity movement and muscle activation patterns in individuals with knee osteoarthritis and healthy age- and gender-matched control subjects. DESIGN: This study utilized a non-randomized case-control design to compare 24 subjects with unilateral symptomatic knee osteoarthritis to 24 age- and gender-matched control subjects without knee osteoarthritis. BACKGROUND: It is hypothesized that knee osteoarthritis is associated with altered lower extremity movement and muscle activation patterns. METHODS: A gait analysis was performed to determine the lower extremity movement and muscle activation patterns when walking on a level surface at 1.12 to 1.34 m/s and while descending a 20 cm step. Paired t-tests were used to compare the average of five trials between the groups. RESULTS: Subjects with knee osteoarthritis demonstrated less excursion of the knee in the sagittal plane from heelstrike to peak flexion before midstance (i.e. during loading). Subjects with knee osteoarthritis also demonstrated reduced peak vertical ground reaction forces relative to body weight. The muscle activity patterns were also different between the groups. The vastus lateralis, medial hamstrings, tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius were on approximately 1.5 times longer than the same muscles in the control subjects. Additionally, significant increases in muscle co-activation were also observed in individuals with knee osteoarthritis during walking. Similar findings were observed when the subject descended a 20 cm step.},

Assessing a priori global identifiability is particularly difficult for nonlinear dynamic models. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature but no solution exists in the general case. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for testing global identifiability of nonlinear dynamic models, based on differential algebra. The characteristic set associated to the dynamic equations is calculated in an efficient way and computer algebra techniques are used to solve the resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The algorithm is capable of handling many features arising in biological system models, including zero initial conditions and time-varying parameters. Examples of usage of the algorithm for analyzing a priori global identifiability of nonlinear models of biological and physiological systems are presented.},

The prosthesis design is described, including its kinematic optimization and the design of a three-axis socket load cell that measures the forces and moments of interaction between the socket and prosthesis. A gait controller is proposed based on the use of passive impedance functions that coordinates the motion of the prosthesis with the user during level walking. The control approach is implemented on the prosthesis prototype and experimental results are shown that demonstrate the promise of the active prosthesis and control approach in restoring fully powered level walking to the user.},

abstract = {This study investigated the full-body strategies utilized during a sit-to-stand (STS) task in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and the association between STS alterations and clinical measurements. Twenty-five patients with advanced knee OA and twenty healthy elderly adults were recruited to participate in this study. Patients were asked to stand up from a chair four times without using their arms. A 3D motion analysis system was used to capture the full-body kinematics during the task. Two force plates were used to capture the forces under each leg. The following parameters were investigated in the knee OA group and compared with the control group: the time to realize STS, the force ratio between both limbs, the knee and hip kinetics and the trunk kinematics. The pain and functional capacity were obtained from the WOMAC. The results showed that patients with knee OA put 10{\%} additional weight on the contralateral side when compared with the symmetrical strategy of the control group. Patients with knee OA showed a significantly lower knee flexion moment (0.51 Nm/kg vs. 0.72 Nm/kg), a higher maximal trunk flexion (46.4° vs. 37.5°), and a higher lateral trunk lean on the contralateral side (2.4° vs. 0.9°) when compared with the control group. The main correlations were found between pain and the averaged time to complete the STS task (r=0.55). With the quantification of the full-body mechanisms utilized during the STS task, which includes both distal and proximal compensations, our study brings new insights, leading to a better understanding of the functional alterations in patients with advanced knee OA.},

abstract = {Transitional movements are a determinant of functional independence and have limited study in amputees. Microprocessor prosthetic knees' abilities to assist transfemoral amputees with sitting and standing have not been studied. Through cross-sectional study, 21 transfemoral amputees, divided into 3 groups of 7 by knee type (power knee, C-leg, Mauch SNS) and 7 non-amputee controls (n=28) performed sit to stand and stand to sit while kinematic and kinetic data were recorded. Transfemoral amputees can stand (1.6-2.0s) and sit (2.1-2.8s) at rates comparable to controls (1.6s). Controls' ground reaction force (GRF) and knee moment production was <7{\%} asymmetric and superior to amputees' during both movements. For sit to stand, amputees' asymmetry for GRF ranged from 53 to 69{\%} and 110 to 124{\%} for knee moments. For stand to sit, amputees' asymmetry for GRF ranged from 32 to 60{\%} and 84 to 114{\%} for knee moments. Hip moment asymmetry for sit to stand was less for control (21{\%}) and power knee (34{\%}) groups than that produced by the Mauch SNS (59{\%}) group. For stand to sit, hip moment production for the Mauch SNS (47{\%}) and C-leg groups (71{\%}) were more asymmetric than controls (19{\%}). In the majority of cases transfemoral amputees do not load their prosthesis extensively for standing up or sitting down. Therefore, this transitional movement is currently a one-legged task, which increases stress on the sound limb. Generally, the prosthetic knees studied did not produce a significant knee moment in either task. Although most differences between knee groups were not statistically significant, differences may be clinically meaningful on an individual basis.},

abstract = {Gait summary measures have been developed as a convenient method to communicate overall gait pathology. These measures are primarily used in the context of paediatric cerebral palsy and their use remains largely untested in other disability groups. This study assessed the suitability of gait summary measures for use with lower limb amputees. Modified (m) versions of three published gait summary measures were investigated - the Gillette Gait Index (mGGI), the Gait Deviation Index (mGDI) and the Gait Profile Score (mGPS) in conjunction with the Movement Analysis Profile (MAP). Twenty unilateral lower limb amputees underwent three-dimensional gait analysis. All measures reported significant differences between levels of amputation on the prosthetic limb. The mGGI and mGPS detected significant differences between the levels of amputation on the intact side, but the mGDI did not. All gait summary measures were moderately to strongly correlated with leg-length normalised self-selected walking speed and strong correlations were reported between all measures. The MAP exposed common strategies in amputee gait and showed that sagittal hip and knee kinematics contributed predominantly to overall gait deviation in this population group. The mGGI, mGDI and mGPS identified, quantified and stratified gait pathology, indicating that any of the gait measures investigated in this study can be applied as outcome measures in research and case management in lower limb amputees.},

abstract = {In order to achieve efficacious walking, transfemoral amputees must adapt coordination within both the artificial and the sound lower limb. We analyzed kinematic strategies in amputees using the planar covariation of lower limb segments approach. When the elevation angles of the thigh, shank and foot are plotted one versus the others, they describe a regular loop which lies close to a plane in normal adults' gait. Orientation of this plane changes with increased speed, in relation to mechanical energetic saving. We used an opto-electronic device to record the elevation angles of both limbs' segments of novice and expert transfemoral amputees and compared them to those of control subjects. The statistical structure underlying the distribution of these angles was described by principal component analysis and Fourier transform. The typical elliptic loop was preserved in prosthetic walking, in both limbs in both novice and expert transfemoral amputees. This reflects a specific control over the thigh elevation angle taking into account knowledge of the other elevation angles throughout the gait cycle. The best-fitting plane of faster trials rotates around the long axis of the gait loop with respect to the plane of slower trials for control subjects, and even more for the sound limb of expert amputees. In contrast, plane rotation is very weak or absent for the prosthetic limb. We suggest that these results reveal a centrally commanded compensation strategy.},

abstract = {A prerequisite for well-posedness of parameter estimation of biological and physiological systems is a priori global identifiability, a property which concerns uniqueness of the solution for the unknown model parameters. Assessing a priori global identifiability is particularly difficult for nonlinear dynamic models. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature but no solution exists in the general case. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for testing global identifiability of nonlinear dynamic models, based on differential algebra. The characteristic set associated to the dynamic equations is calculated in an efficient way and computer algebra techniques are used to solve the resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The algorithm is capable of handling many features arising in biological system models, including zero initial conditions and time-varying parameters. Examples of usage of the algorithm for analyzing a priori global identifiability of nonlinear models of biological and physiological systems are presented.},

@article{Yeung2012,
abstract = {Trans-tibial amputees are advised to walk as much as able people to achieve healthy and independent life. However, they usually have difficulties in doing so. Previous researches only included data from a few steps when studying the gait of amputees. Walking over a long distance was rarely examined. The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in spatial-temporal, kinetic and kinematic gait parameters of trans-tibial amputees after long-distance walking. Six male unilateral trans-tibial amputees performed two sessions of 30-min walking on a level treadmill at their self-selected comfortable speed. Gait analysis was undertaken over-ground: (1) before walking, (2) after the 1st walking session and (3) after the 2nd walking session. After the long-distance walking, changes in spatial-temporal gait parameters were small and insignificant. However, the sound side ankle rocker progression and push-off were significantly reduced. This was due to the fatigue of the sound side plantar flexors and was compensated by the greater effort in the prosthetic side. The prosthetic side knee joint showed significantly increased flexion and moment during loading response to facilitate the anterior rotation of the prosthetic shank. The prosthetic side hip extensors also provided more power at terminal stance to facilitate propulsion. Endurance training of the sound side plantar flexors, and improvements in the prosthetic design to assist anterior rotation of the prosthetic shank should improve long-distance walking in trans-tibial amputees.},

abstract = {The prosthetic foot plays an important role in propelling, breaking, balancing and supporting body loads while the amputee ambulates on different grounds. It is therefore important to quantify the effect of the prosthetic foot mechanism on biomechanical parameters, in order to prevent pressure ulcers and deep tissue injury. Our aim was to monitor the internal stresses in the residuum of transtibial amputation (TTA) prosthetic-users ambulating on different terrains, which the amputees encounter during their daily activities, i.e. paved floor, grass, ascending and descending stairs and slope. We specifically aimed to compare between the internal stresses in the TTA residuum of amputees ambulating with a novel hydraulic prosthetic foot compared to conventional energy storage and return (ESR) prosthetic feet. Monitoring of internal stresses was accomplished using a portable subject-specific real-time internal stress monitor. We found significant decrease (p<0.01) in peak internal stresses and in the loading rate of the amputated limb, while walking with the hydraulic foot, compared to walking with ESR feet. The loading rate calculated while ambulating with the hydraulic foot was at least three times lower than the loading rate calculated while ambulating with the ESR foot. Although the average decrease in internal stresses was ≈ 2-fold larger when replacing single-toe ESR feet with the hydraulic foot than when replacing split-toed ESR feet with the hydraulic foot, the differences were statistically insignificant. Our findings suggest that using a hydraulic prosthetic foot may protect the distal tibial end of the TTA residuum from high stresses, therefore preventing pressure-related injury and pain.},

@article{Schwartz2008,
abstract = {This article describes a new multivariate measure of overall gait pathology called the Gait Deviation Index (GDI). The first step in developing the GDI was to use kinematic data from a large number of walking strides to derive a set of mutually independent joint rotation patterns that efficiently describe gait. These patterns are called gait features. Linear combinations of the first 15 gait features produced a 98{\%} faithful reconstruction of both the data from which they were derived and 1000 validation strides not used in the derivation. The GDI was then defined as a scaled distance between the 15 gait feature scores for a subject and the average of the same 15 gait feature scores for a control group of typically developing (TD) children. Concurrent and face validity data for the GDI are presented through comparisons with the Gillette Gait Index (GGI), Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire Walking Scale (FAQ), and topographic classifications within the diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy (CP). The GDI and GGI are strongly correlated (r(2)=0.56). The GDI scales with FAQ level, distinguishes levels from one another, and is normally distributed across FAQ levels six to ten and among TD children. The GDI also scales with respect to clinical involvement based on topographic CP classification in Hemiplegia Types I-IV, Diplegia, Triplegia and Quadriplegia. The GDI offers an alternative to the GGI as a comprehensive quantitative gait pathology index, and can be readily computed using the electronic addendum provided with this article.},

@article{Baker2009,
abstract = {The Gait Deviation Index (GDI) has been proposed as an index of overall gait pathology. This study proposes an interpretation of the difference measure upon which the GDI is based, which naturally leads to the definition of a similar index, the Gait Profile Score (GPS). The GPS can be calculated independently of the feature analysis upon which the GDI is based. Understanding what the underlying difference measure represents also suggests that reporting a raw score, as the GPS does, may have advantages over the logarithmic transformation and z-scaling incorporated in the GDI. It also leads to the concept of a Movement Analysis Profile (MAP) to summarise much of the information contained within kinematic data. A validation study on all children attending a paediatric gait analysis service over 3 years (407 children) provides evidence to support the use of the GPS through analysis of its frequency distribution across different Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) categories, investigation of intra-session variability, and correlation with the square root of GGI. Correlation with GDI confirms the strong relationship between the two measures. The study concludes that GDI and GPS are alternative and closely related measures. The GDI has prior art and is particularly useful in applications arising out of feature analysis such as cluster analysis or subject matching. The GPS will be easier to calculate for new models where a large reference dataset is not available and in association with applications using the MAP.},

abstract = {Gait summary measures have been developed as a convenient method to communicate overall gait pathology. These measures are primarily used in the context of paediatric cerebral palsy and their use remains largely untested in other disability groups. This study assessed the suitability of gait summary measures for use with lower limb amputees. Modified (m) versions of three published gait summary measures were investigated - the Gillette Gait Index (mGGI), the Gait Deviation Index (mGDI) and the Gait Profile Score (mGPS) in conjunction with the Movement Analysis Profile (MAP). Twenty unilateral lower limb amputees underwent three-dimensional gait analysis. All measures reported significant differences between levels of amputation on the prosthetic limb. The mGGI and mGPS detected significant differences between the levels of amputation on the intact side, but the mGDI did not. All gait summary measures were moderately to strongly correlated with leg-length normalised self-selected walking speed and strong correlations were reported between all measures. The MAP exposed common strategies in amputee gait and showed that sagittal hip and knee kinematics contributed predominantly to overall gait deviation in this population group. The mGGI, mGDI and mGPS identified, quantified and stratified gait pathology, indicating that any of the gait measures investigated in this study can be applied as outcome measures in research and case management in lower limb amputees.},

Statistical tests of the method's validity and an initial demonstration of its clinical utility are included.

@article{Xu2013,
abstract = {Estimation of on-off timing of human skeletal muscles during movement is an ongoing issue in surface electromyography (sEMG) signal processing for relevant clinical applications. Widely used single threshold methods still rely on the experience of the operator to manually establish a threshold level. In this paper, a novel approach to address this issue is presented. Based on the generalized likelihood ratio test, the maximum likelihood (ML) method is improved with an adaptive threshold technique based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimate in the initial time before accurate sEMG analyses. The dependence of optimal threshold on SNR is determined by minimizing the onset/offset estimate error on a large set of simulated signals with well-known signal parameters. Accuracy and precision of the algorithm were assessed by using a set of simulated signals and real sEMG signals recorded from two healthy subjects during elbow flexion-extension movements with and without workload. Comparison with traditional algorithms shows that with a moderate increase in the computational effort the ML algorithm performs well even for low levels of EMG activity, while the proposed adaptive method is most robust with respect to variations in SNRs. Also, we discuss the results of analyzing the sEMG recordings from the selected proximal muscles of the upper limb in two hemiparetic subjects. The detection algorithm is automatic and user-independent, managing the detection of both onset and offset activation, and is applicable in presence of noise allowing use by skilled and unskilled operators alike.},

abstract = {The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network (NN) is a well-established computational model of the human cerebellum. Nevertheless, there are two major drawbacks associated with the uniform quantization scheme of the CMAC network. They are the following: (1) a constant output resolution associated with the entire input space and (2) the generalization-accuracy dilemma. Moreover, the size of the CMAC network is an exponential function of the number of inputs. Depending on the characteristics of the training data, only a small percentage of the entire set of CMAC memory cells is utilized. Therefore, the efficient utilization of the CMAC memory is a crucial issue. One approach is to quantize the input space nonuniformly. For existing nonuniformly quantized CMAC systems, there is a tradeoff between memory efficiency and computational complexity. Inspired by the underlying organizational mechanism of the human brain, this paper presents a novel CMAC architecture named hierarchically clustered adaptive quantization CMAC (HCAQ-CMAC). HCAQ-CMAC employs hierarchical clustering for the nonuniform quantization of the input space to identify significant input segments and subsequently allocating more memory cells to these regions. The stability of the HCAQ-CMAC network is theoretically guaranteed by the proof of its learning convergence. The performance of the proposed network is subsequently benchmarked against the original CMAC network, as well as two other existing CMAC variants on two real-life applications, namely, automated control of car maneuver and modeling of the human blood glucose dynamics. The experimental results have demonstrated that the HCAQ-CMAC network offers an efficient memory allocation scheme and improves the generalization and accuracy of the network output to achieve better or comparable performances with smaller memory usages. Index Terms-Cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC), hierarchical clustering, hierarchically clustered adaptive quantization CMAC (HCAQ-CMAC), learning convergence, nonuniform quantization.},

abstract = {This study proposes an islanding detection method for photovoltaic power generation systems based on a cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network. First, islanding phenomenon test data were used as training samples to train the CMAC neural network. Then, a photovoltaic power generation system was tested with the islanding phenomena. Because the CMAC neural network possesses association and induction abilities and characteristics that activate similar input signals in approximate memory during training process, the CMAC only requires that the weight values of the excited memory addresses be adjusted, thereby reducing the training time. Furthermore, quantification of the input signals enhanced the detection tolerance of the proposed method. Finally, the simulative and experimental data verified the feasibility of adopting the proposed detection method for islanding phenomena.},

@article{Kara2000a,
abstract = {Vision has extensively expanded robots' capabilities, making the
robot control problem more complex. To track a target with a robot arm
in a three-dimensional space involves the use of precise commands. We
propose to insert a hierarchical neurocontroller based on CMAC
(cerebellar model articulation controller) networks in a visual servoing
loop. This hierarchical structure splits the robot's workspace and
assigns different CMAC controllers imposing thus a specialized region
CMAC. Compared to a single CMAC with the same number of weights, the
neurocontroller's sensitivity and precision is increased. Robot
positioning and target tracking with visual feedback can then be done
with a better precision},

abstract = {A cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) control system, which contains only one single-input controller implemented by a differentiable CMAC, is proposed in this paper. In the proposed scheme, the CMAC controller is solely used to control the plant, and no conventional controller is needed. Without a preliminary offline learning, the single-input CMAC controller can provide the control effort to the plant at each online learning step. To train the differentiable CMAC online, the gradient descent algorithm is employed to derive the learning rules. The sensitivity of the plant, with respect to the input, is approximated by a simple formula so that the learning rules can be applied to unknown plants. Moreover, based on a discrete-type Lyapunov function, conditions on the learning rates guaranteeing the convergence of the output error are derived in this paper. Finally, simulations on controlling three different plants are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

@article{Kim2000,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the application of quadratic
optimization for motion control to feedback control of robotic systems
using cerebellar model arithmetic computer (CMAC) neural networks.
Explicit solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (H-J-B) equation for
optimal control of robotic systems are found by solving an algebraic
Riccati equation. It is shown how the CMAC can cope with nonlinearities
through optimization with no preliminary off-line learning phase
required. The adaptive-learning algorithm is derived from Lyapunov
stability analysis, so that both system-tracking stability and error
convergence can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system. The
filtered-tracking error or critic gain and the Lyapunov function for the
nonlinear analysis are derived from the user input in terms of a
specified quadratic-performance index. Simulation results from a
two-link robot manipulator show the satisfactory performance of the
proposed control schemes even in the presence of large modeling
uncertainties and external disturbances},

abstract = {A nonlinear proportional-derivative controller plus adaptive neuronal network compensation is proposed. With the aim of estimating the desired torque, a two-layer neural network is used. Then, adaptation laws for the neural network weights are derived. Asymptotic convergence of the position and velocity tracking errors is proven, while the neural network weights are shown to be uniformly bounded. The proposed scheme has been experimentally validated in real time. These experimental evaluations were carried in two different mechanical systems: a horizontal two degrees-of-freedom robot and a vertical one degree-of-freedom arm which is affected by the gravitational force. In each one of the two experimental set-ups, the proposed scheme was implemented without and with adaptive neural network compensation. Experimental results confirmed the tracking accuracy of the proposed adaptive neural network-based controller.},

abstract = {The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network is capable of learning nonlinear functions extremely quickly due to the local nature of its weight updating. The rectangular shape of CMAC receptive field functions, however, produces discontinuous (staircase) function approximations without inherent analytical derivatives. The ability to learn both functions and function derivatives is important for the development of many online adaptive filter, estimation, and control algorithms. It is shown that use of B-spline receptive field functions in conjunction with more general CMAC weight addressing schemes allows higher-order CMAC neural networks to be developed that can learn both functions and function derivatives. This also allows hierarchical and multilayer CMAC network architectures to be constructed that can be trained using standard error back-propagation learning techniques.},

@book{Bishop2006a,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

The basic control method for HAL had been performed by using myoelectricity which reflects operator's intention. As the application of the basic method, we considered the control method of power assist based on another information by considering the relation between myoelectricity and another information of motion, and the recognition method for the control method. We adopted phase sequence control which generated a series of assist motions by the transition of some fundamental motions called phase. The result of experiments showed the effective power assist which reflected operator's intention by using this control method.},

The initial prototype is a pneumatically actuated powered-tethered device, which is intended to serve as a laboratory test bed for a subsequent self-powered version. The prosthesis design is described, including its kinematic optimization and the design of a three-axis socket load cell that measures the forces and moments of interaction between the socket and prosthesis. A gait controller is proposed based on the use of passive impedance functions that coordinates the motion of the prosthesis with the user during level walking. The control approach is implemented on the prosthesis prototype and experimental results are shown that demonstrate the promise of the active prosthesis and control approach in restoring fully powered level walking to the user.},

The current paper reviews available wearable sensors and ambulatory gait analysis methods based on the various wearable sensors. After an introduction of the gait phases, the principles and features of wearable sensors used in gait analysis are provided. The gait analysis methods based on wearable sensors is divided into gait kinematics, gait kinetics, and electromyography. Studies on the current methods are reviewed, and applications in sports, rehabilitation, and clinical diagnosis are summarized separately. With the development of sensor technology and the analysis method, gait analysis using wearable sensors is expected to play an increasingly important role in clinical applications.},

The motion measurement system utilizes a video-based data collection strategy similar to commercially available systems for motion data collection. Anatomically aligned, passive, retroreflective markers placed on the subject are illuminated, detected, and stored in dedicated camera hardware while data are acquired from force platforms and EMG transducers. Three-dimensional marker position information is used to determine: (i) the orientation of segmentally-embedded coordinate systems, (ii) instantaneous joint center locations, and (iii) joint angles. Joint kinetics, i.e., moments and powers, may also be computed if valid force plate data are collected.},

abstract = {There are several pathological conditions that modify the gait pattern in the infant population, in order to evaluate this pattern it is necessary to compare it to parameters studied in ldquonormalrdquo individuals, clinically healthy. For this reason, it results necessary to count with normal parameters specific for this kind of population. However, the studies that are in the literature about the pediatric gait development do not provide enough information to perform evaluations where comparisons with healthy individuals are necessary. The objective of this study was to obtain a data base of the spatio-temporal gait parameters of pediatric healthy Mexican subjects, providing new information about this kind of gait, thus this information can subsequently be included in different motion analysis softwares. With this purpose, a descriptive study analyzed the gait of 120 children (61 boys and 59 girls) between the ages of 6 and 13, analyzing how the age affects the spatio-temporal gait parameters. Significant differences were noted with the age in the great majority of the spatio-temporal gait parameters. In addition, significant differences were found from those reported in the literature for normal adult gait.},

abstract = {The Gait Profile Score (GPS) is a single index measure that summarises the overall deviation of kinematic gait data relative to normative data. The GPS can be decomposed to provide Gait Variable Scores (GVS) of nine key component kinematic gait variables, which are presented as a Movement Analysis Profile (MAP). The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of the GPS and MAP relative to clinician judgments.Kinematic data were selected from 60 children and inspected by 17 experienced clinicians. The degree of abnormality of the overall unilateral gait pattern and the nine kinematic variables was rated according to a 0-10 point scale.Strong, significant, positive correlations were found between the GPS and MAP component scores, and clinicians' ratings of kinematic gait deviation, with Spearman correlations ranging from 0.84 to 0.97. These high correlations provide evidence that the GPS and the MAP have criterion-related validity relative to clinician judgments. We propose that the GPS and particularly its MAP decomposition may be useful in clinical practice and education as an adjunct to the traditional presentation of complex kinematic data. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Sutherland2002,
abstract = {Kinematics is treated as a single topic in this manuscript and the emphasis is on early history, just as it was in Part I, Electromyography. Needless to say, neither kinematics nor electromyography, nor kinetics and energy (the latter to be included in Part III) are stand-alone components of clinical gait analysis. The only reason for this selective format is that it lessens my task to be able to write about one subject at a time. One of the consequences of this arbitrary separation is that some contributors, who have enriched more than one portion of clinical gait analysis, are highlighted only in the area in which they have contributed the most. I began with Kinesiological Electromyography in Part I because the earliest stirrings of the dream of clinical gait analysis were expressed in the development of KEMG (kinesiological electromyography). The early investigators realized that very little could be said about the dynamic action of muscles without KEMG. Next, in chronological order, came kinematics. I have been an active participant and eyewitness, and take full responsibility for attempting to write an early history at a time when most of the contributors are still alive. Ordinarily, history is written much later, in order to fully grasp the significance of individual contributions in the tapestry of the whole. As stated in Part I, Electromyography, the emphasis has been placed on the early history. The application of motion analysis to sports medicine, and sports medicine functional analysis, is covered only lightly here, and this should not be interpreted as minimizing its importance. The literature on this subject is now quite voluminous and it would not be possible to cover it adequately in this manuscript. Later historical writings may differ significantly and will hopefully give more recognition to pioneers in later generations: those physicians, engineers, physical therapists and kinesiologists who are lifting the level of clinical gait analysis and directing their energies in expanding clinical directions. It is hoped that this manuscript will prompt additional manuscripts, as well as letters to the editor of Gait and Posture on the content of this review paper.},

abstract = {The Microsoft Kinect sensor has gained attention as a tool for gait analysis for several years. Despite the many advantages the sensor provides, however, the lack of a native capability to extract joints from the side view of a human body still limits the adoption of the device to a number of relevant applications. This paper presents an algorithm to locate and estimate the trajectories of up to six joints extracted from the side depth view of a human body captured by the Kinect device. The algorithm is then applied to extract data that can be exploited to provide an objective score for the ``Get Up and Go Test'', which is typically adopted for gait analysis in rehabilitation fields. Starting from the depth-data stream provided by the Microsoft Kinect sensor, the proposed algorithm relies on anthropometric models only, to locate and identify the positions of the joints. Differently from machine learning approaches, this solution avoids complex computations, which usually require significant resources. The reliability of the information about the joint position output by the algorithm is evaluated by comparison to a marker-based system. Tests show that the trajectories extracted by the proposed algorithm adhere to the reference curves better than the ones obtained from the skeleton generated by the native applications provided within the Microsoft Kinect (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA, 2013) and OpenNI (OpenNI organization, Tel Aviv, Israel, 2013) Software Development Kits.},

Nevertheless, software development in an academic setting is often unsystematic, which can lead to problems associated with maintenance and long-term availibility. Unfortunately, well-documented software development methodology is difficult to adopt, and technical measures that directly improve bioinformatic programming have not been described comprehensively. We have examined 22 software projects and have identified a set of practices for software development in an academic environment. We found them useful to plan a project, support the involvement of experts (e.g. experimentalists), and to promote higher quality and maintainability of the resulting programs. This article describes 12 techniques that facilitate a quick start into software engineering. We describe 3 of the 22 projects in detail and give many examples to illustrate the usage of particular techniques. We expect this toolbox to be useful for many bioinformatics programming projects and to the training of scientific programmers.},

abstract = {There is a lack of measures that quantify functional knee stability, which is of particular relevance in knee rehabilitation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of knee finite helical axis (FHA) variables in 33 healthy subjects during two different functional tasks; One leg side hop (SH) and Two Leg Squat (TLS), and to investigate correlations of these variables with laxity. Laxity was assessed with a KT-1000 arthrometer and the Beighton Hypermobility Score. Movements were registered with an optical motion capture system. Knee rotation and translation were defined by a six degree of freedom segment model. FHA was calculated for finite steps of 20° knee flexion, based on error simulations. We computed the FHA inclination, the translation along FHA and an FHA Direction Index quantifying directional changes. All variables were repeatable (average ICCs {\~{}}0.97 during TLS and {\~{}}0.83 during SH). The lower functional knee stability in SH was reflected by a significantly higher FHA Direction Index and a larger medio-lateral FHA inclination compared to those in TLS. The superior-inferior inclination was smaller during Landing in SH compared to Take-Off and TLS. Translation along FHA was generally small as expected in healthy subjects. Beighton Hypermobility Score and KT-1000 values had weak but significant correlations with FHA Direction Index and FHA translation, which show that laxity influences the functional knee stability. We conclude that FHA measures were sensitive enough to discriminate between SH and TLS. The next step is to investigate the usability of these measures in subjects with knee injury. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The kinematic analysis of gait during pregnancy provides more information about the anatomical changes and contributes to exercise and rehabilitation prescription. The purposes were to quantify the lower limb kinematics of gait and to compare it between the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and with a control group. A three-dimensional analysis was performed in twenty-two pregnant women and twelve nonpregnant. Repeated Measures and Manova tests were performed for comparisons between trimesters and between pregnant and controls. The walking speed, stride width, right-/left-step time, cycle time and time of support, and flight phases remain unchanged between trimesters and between pregnant and controls. Stride and right-/left-step lengths decreased between trimesters. Double limb support time increased between trimesters, and it increased when compared with controls. Joint kinematics showed a significant decrease of right-hip extension and adduction during stance phase between trimesters and when compared with controls. Also, an increase in left-knee flexion and a decrease in right-ankle plantarflexion were found between trimesters. The results suggested that pregnant women need to maintain greater stability of body and to become more efficient in locomotion. Further data from the beginning of pregnancy anthropometric data may contribute to the analysis.},

abstract = {Aristotle (384-322 BCE) can be attributed with the earliest recorded comments regarding the manner in which humans walk. It was not until the renaissance that further progress was made through the experiments and theorising of Giovanni Borelli (1608-1679). Although several scientists wrote about walking through the enlightenment period it was the brothers Willhelm (1804-1891) and Eduard (1806-1871) Weber, working in Leipzig who made the next major contribution based on very simple measurements. Both Jules Etienne Marey (1830-1904), working in France, and Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904), working in America, made significant advances in measurement technology. These were developed further by Otto Fischer (1861-1917) in collaboration with Willhelm Braune (1831-1892). The major developments in the early twentieth century were in the development of force plates and the understanding of kinetics. The team headed by Verne Inman (1905-1980) and Howard Eberhart (1906-1993) made major advances in America shortly after the Second War. David Sutherland (1923-2006) and Jacquelin Perry pioneered clinical applications in America and Jurg Baumann (1926-2000) in Europe. It was not until the advent of modern computers that clinical gait analysis became widely available. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Historically, clinical applications of measurements of force and energy followed electromyography and kinematics in temporal sequence. This sequence is mirrored by the order of topics included in this trilogy on the Evolution of Clinical Gait Analysis, with part I [Sutherland DH. The evolution of clinical gait analysis part I: kinesiological EMG. Gait Posture 2001;14:61-70.] devoted to Kinesiological EMG and part II [Sutherland DH. The evolution of clinical gait analysis part II - kinematics. Gait Posture 2002;16(2):159-179.] to Kinematics. This final review in the series will focus on kinetics as it relates to gait applications. Kinematic measurements give the movements of the body segments, which can be compared with normal controls to identify pathological gait patterns, but they do not deal with the forces controlling the movements. As a major goal of scientifically minded clinicians is to understand the biomechanical forces producing movements, the objective measurement of ground reaction forces is essential. The force plate (platform) is now an indispensable tool in a state-of-the-art motion analysis laboratory. Nonetheless, it is not a stand-alone instrument as both kinematic and EMG measurements are needed for maximum clinical implementation and interpretation of force plate measurements. The subject of energy assessment is also given mention, as there is a compelling interest in whether walking has been made easier with intervention. The goals of this manuscript are to provide a historical background, recognize some of the important contributors, and describe the current multiple uses of the force plate in gait analysis. The widespread use of force plates for postural analyses is an important and more recent application of this technology, but this review will be restricted to measurements of gait rather than balance activities. Finally, this manuscript presents my personal perspective and discusses the developments and contributors that have shaped my thoughts and actions, and which I have found to be particularly noteworthy or intriguing. Just as in parts I and II, emphasis has been placed on the early development. All subtopics and important contributors, in this third and certainly most challenging of the review papers, have not been included. Some may find that my perceptions are incomplete. I accept responsibility for all deficiencies, as none were intended. Letters to selected contributors and their responses reveal how each contributor built on the work of others. The level of cooperation and sharing by these early investigators is extraordinary. Had they wished to withhold information about their own work, clinical gait analysis would have been severely delayed. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A simple and rapid automatic method for detection of gait events at the foot could speed up and possibly increase the repeatability of gait analysis and evaluations of treatments for pathological gaits. The aim of this study was to compare and validate a kinematic-based algorithm used in the detection of four gait events, heel contact, heel rise, toe contact and toe off. Force platform data is often used to obtain start and end of contact phases, but not usually heel rise and toe contact events. For this purpose synchronised kinematic, kinetic and video data were captured from 12 healthy adult subjects walking both barefoot and shod at slow and normal self-selected speeds. The data were used to determine the gait events using three methods: force, visual inspection and algorithm methods. Ninety percent of all timings given by the algorithm were within one frame (16.7ms) when compared to visual inspection. There were no statistically significant differences between the visual and algorithm timings. For both heel and toe contact the differences between the three methods were within 1.5 frames, whereas for heel rise and toe off the differences between the force on one side and the visual and algorithm on the other were higher and more varied (up to 175ms). In addition, the algorithm method provided the duration of three intervals, heel contact to toe contact, toe contact to heel rise and heel rise to toe off, which are not readily available from force platform data. The ability to automatically and reliably detect the timings of these four gait events and three intervals using kinematic data alone is an asset to clinical gait analysis. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In 1996, I was asked by Roy Davis, President of the Gait and Clinical Movement Analysis Society, to be the presidential guest speaker at the Birmingham, AL, annual society meeting and present a talk on the development of clinical gait analysis. Following my presentation, James Gage, Editor-in-Chief for Gait and Posture, and David Winter, Associate Editor for review articles requested a manuscript for publication. To address this task I have the advantage of being a participant throughout this exciting era and of personally knowing most of the people mentioned in this manuscript. To prepare for this assignment, I wrote letters and/or made phone calls to them. Their replies to my inquiries, plus their publications, provide documentation for this review paper. The opinions expressed, for better or worse, are my own. Due to space limitations, only a partial list of the many that have contributed is presented and I regret that not all of the important contributors have been included. In some instances they will be found in Part II and Part III. Hopefully, later publications on this subject will correct the omissions. Emphasis has been given to the earliest years and to walking gait. The subject of upper extremity analysis has not been included, though studies of subjects with upper extremity motion problems are carried out in many motion laboratories including our own. A further disclaimer is that the flood of more recent publications does not receive equal coverage. History is being written daily as clinical gait analysis gains momentum. We have barely scratched the surface of the development and potential contributions of clinical gait analysis. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

A video camera is used to acquire images of a walking person, fitted with a set of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The acquired trajectories of the light points are then used to specify joint trajectories in a biped robot. To analyze the stability of the human gait, a system was also developed to acquire the center of pressure (CoP). This system uses eight force sensors, four under each foot. The influence of the human torso angle on the CoP position during walking was confirmed. Some experiments were carried out on a biped robot, and the results show that the acquired human gait can be used in a biped robot, after scale conversion.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},
