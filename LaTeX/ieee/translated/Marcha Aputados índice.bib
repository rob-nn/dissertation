abstract = {This article describes a new multivariate measure of overall gait pathology called the Gait Deviation Index (GDI). The first step in developing the GDI was to use kinematic data from a large number of walking strides to derive a set of mutually independent joint rotation patterns that efficiently describe gait. These patterns are called gait features. Linear combinations of the first 15 gait features produced a 98{\%} faithful reconstruction of both the data from which they were derived and 1000 validation strides not used in the derivation. The GDI was then defined as a scaled distance between the 15 gait feature scores for a subject and the average of the same 15 gait feature scores for a control group of typically developing (TD) children. Concurrent and face validity data for the GDI are presented through comparisons with the Gillette Gait Index (GGI), Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire Walking Scale (FAQ), and topographic classifications within the diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy (CP). The GDI and GGI are strongly correlated (r(2)=0.56). The GDI scales with FAQ level, distinguishes levels from one another, and is normally distributed across FAQ levels six to ten and among TD children. The GDI also scales with respect to clinical involvement based on topographic CP classification in Hemiplegia Types I-IV, Diplegia, Triplegia and Quadriplegia. The GDI offers an alternative to the GGI as a comprehensive quantitative gait pathology index, and can be readily computed using the electronic addendum provided with this article.},

@article{Baker2009,
abstract = {The Gait Deviation Index (GDI) has been proposed as an index of overall gait pathology. This study proposes an interpretation of the difference measure upon which the GDI is based, which naturally leads to the definition of a similar index, the Gait Profile Score (GPS). The GPS can be calculated independently of the feature analysis upon which the GDI is based. Understanding what the underlying difference measure represents also suggests that reporting a raw score, as the GPS does, may have advantages over the logarithmic transformation and z-scaling incorporated in the GDI. It also leads to the concept of a Movement Analysis Profile (MAP) to summarise much of the information contained within kinematic data. A validation study on all children attending a paediatric gait analysis service over 3 years (407 children) provides evidence to support the use of the GPS through analysis of its frequency distribution across different Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) categories, investigation of intra-session variability, and correlation with the square root of GGI. Correlation with GDI confirms the strong relationship between the two measures. The study concludes that GDI and GPS are alternative and closely related measures. The GDI has prior art and is particularly useful in applications arising out of feature analysis such as cluster analysis or subject matching. The GPS will be easier to calculate for new models where a large reference dataset is not available and in association with applications using the MAP.},

@article{Kark2012a,
abstract = {Gait summary measures have been developed as a convenient method to communicate overall gait pathology. These measures are primarily used in the context of paediatric cerebral palsy and their use remains largely untested in other disability groups. This study assessed the suitability of gait summary measures for use with lower limb amputees. Modified (m) versions of three published gait summary measures were investigated - the Gillette Gait Index (mGGI), the Gait Deviation Index (mGDI) and the Gait Profile Score (mGPS) in conjunction with the Movement Analysis Profile (MAP). Twenty unilateral lower limb amputees underwent three-dimensional gait analysis. All measures reported significant differences between levels of amputation on the prosthetic limb. The mGGI and mGPS detected significant differences between the levels of amputation on the intact side, but the mGDI did not. All gait summary measures were moderately to strongly correlated with leg-length normalised self-selected walking speed and strong correlations were reported between all measures. The MAP exposed common strategies in amputee gait and showed that sagittal hip and knee kinematics contributed predominantly to overall gait deviation in this population group. The mGGI, mGDI and mGPS identified, quantified and stratified gait pathology, indicating that any of the gait measures investigated in this study can be applied as outcome measures in research and case management in lower limb amputees.},

@article{Schutte2000,
abstract = {A method is derived to calculate the amount by which a subject's gait deviates from an average normal profile, and to represent this deviation as a single number. The method uses principal component analysis to derive a set of 16 independent variables from 16 selected gait variables. The sum of the square of these 16 independent variables is interpreted as the deviation of the subject's gait from normal. Statistical tests of the method's validity and an initial demonstration of its clinical utility are included. It is found that using this index, increasing clinical involvement corresponds to increasing index score.},
