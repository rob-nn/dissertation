\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

	This paper presents the implementation of a human gait analysis Software as a Service (SaaS).
	This approach has as advantage, the software availability at the web.
	After the software is implanted at a webserver, users may access it from a recent
	web browser with HTML5 support.
	The goal of software is to minimize code development efforts of researchers from gait analysis, 
	as well as to be useful tool for health professionals interested in the human gait analysis.
	The software allows import positional data from a third party motion captures system,
	that uses surface markers and video cameras, to plot markers spatial progression, 
	angles, angular velocities and angular accelerations. Furthermore, it is possible
	to see and to interact with a 3D animation from markers. 
	The software source code is available as free software,
	often receive new features and a new community is being created to maintain it.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{W}{ith} the advent of software web, is possible to create services
that are placed at webservers and access it  from anywhere.
Furthermore, modern web browsers have become a truly platform, which allows
create rich interfaces that include graphical presentation and 3D animations
without the need of plugins installations.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
These two technologies, web browsers and webservers, may be used to build
what is known as Software as a Service (SaaS). The SaaS advantages for 
customers and software developers are \cite{Fox2012}: customers do not need
to install the application; data associated with the service should be kept centralized,
so it is protected; data may be collectively accessed by a group of users;
big datasets and data that is frequently updated, are kept centralized 
and remote access to them are offered; only a single copy of the server software
runs in a controlled hardware and operating system environment, which avoids
compatibility problems, in addition, new versions of the software can be 
tested with a small fraction of the real customers without disturbing most
customers.

Although there was advances on the gait analysis by the middle of century XX, 
clinic gait analysis became broadly available only
with the modern computer advent \cite{Baker2007}.
Actually, there are a lot of software packages for this porpouse \cite{Moraes2003}.
But until now there are no software provider committed to deliver a 
gait analysis SaaS. in other words, health professionals or gait analysis researchers
who need to use software, must install it at specific hardware and
operating system. Furthermore, they have to be responsible by data backup and if there are
new software versions, it must be installed again. Whether they
need to share data, then must copy and send it to the destiny. In addition, others
security concerns must be addressed as well.
These problems may be minimized or even eliminated with a SaaS.

In order to implement a software is essential to accomplish the requirements elicitation 
and a certain domain of the field should be understood, in this case gait analysis. 
Nowadays, the theme is quite documented
\cite{Perry2010, Whittle2012, Ferreira2009, Vieira2015, 
Duhamel2004, Ghoussayni2004, Moreno2009, Beynon2010}. 
Moreover, there are experienced health professionals in the development
with knowledge on gait analysis. 
Then, this paper presents the
first implementation version of a gait analysis SaaS \cite{Lima2015}.
This software version may import data from a third party motion capture system, in this
case data collected from video cameras using surface markers. Also the software
may name markers, define angles, and plot 
markers progression at space, angles, angular velocities and angular accelerations.
So, the software presents a 3D animation from imported data and allows user 
interact with it.

\section{Materials and Methods}

Two researche environments were used to undertake the project. 
One was the Human Performance Lab (\emph{Laboratório de Performance Humana} - LPH) in
Universty of Brasilia (\emph{Universidade de Brasilia} - UnB) at Ceilandia, 
and the other was the Health Informatics Lab (\emph{Laboratorio de Informatica em Saude} - LIS)
in UnB at Gama. 
Data acquisition was made in LPH and software development tasks at LIS.

The next subsections presents the process for data acquisition,
the development process and the general
view of the software architecture.

\subsection{Data Acquisition}

The data are acquired by sixteen Qualisys Oqus cameras that use
the Qualisys Track Manager Software (QTM). 
The data are relative to surface markers along a patient's body.

For this paper a healthy patient, male, with age between 20 and 30 years old
was selected.
Fig. \ref{data_acq_proc} summarizes the data acquisition process.
First,  the  markers positions are defined by the gait analisys specialist. 
For this paper, only the left trochanter, left knee and left tibia
positions were considered. 
So the surface markers must be setted at defined positions on patient's body.
The next step is acquire data from the cameras and QTM software. In this
step, the patient perfoms a comfortable gait cycle in front of the cameras.
Then, five gait samples were acquired.
The last step is convert the acquired data to MATLAB format that use the QTM
software. Furthermore, it is important due to the standard choosen for 
the gait analysis software.

The process for data acquisition was approved by Ethics Committee from Faculty of Health 
\emph{Faculdade de Saude} / UnB  
process number N11911/12.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Development Process}

A scrum \cite{Schwaber2001, Schwaber2004, Rubin2012} inspired process for development was implanted.
The scrum is a agile method \cite{Beck2001} that has as mainly characteristics
to be iterative, incremental and change friendly.
These characteristics are essentials to deal with software requirements volatility
and, hence, with software changes.

The process flow is presented in Fig. \ref{dev_proc}.
These process consist of iterations called sprints.
The sprints have a 2 weeks average duration.
Therefore, a product backlog is created and managed by the product owner.
Also the product backlog is open to receive additions from any
project stakeholders, at any time, but only the product owner may prioritize it,
that are based in expected values for final users.
Each item at the product backlog is a user story \cite{cohn2004}.

Before a new iteration begins, there are a two phases meeting between the development team members. 
In the first phase, the last increment is presented and 
impediments occurred in the last iteration are revealed.
In the second phase, the development team selects items from the product backlog.
These items will be implemented in the sprint and are called the sprint backlog.
Finally , is delivered an increment that consist in a piece of working software.

\subsection{Software Architecture General View}
The Fig. \ref{app_layers} shows the software architecture layered high level view.
The web applications layer is responsible by application user interactions (Section \ref{web_application_layer}).
The layer REST web API is responsible by business logic, (Section \ref{rest_web_api_layer}).
The document base layer is responsible by data application persistence (Section \ref{document_base_layer}).

\subsubsection{Web Application Layer}
\label{web_application_layer}

This layer was designed to run in web browsers with HTML5 support.
It was developed with Javascript, CSS and HTML languages. 
Moreover, the web development framework AngularJS was adopted \cite{Branas2014,Freeman2014}. 
A great AngularJS adoption advantage is the directive creation possibility. 
Directives are developed components which may be embedded in a HTML template.
Also, it was chosen to use the Angular-Material directive library. 
This library is based in the Material Design specification from Google, which
describes about graphical design patterns and user interaction, it is based in the material metaphor
\cite{Google2015a}. The Angular-Material use, so it is possible to build a user experience that are acceptable by health professionals.

The ThreeJS library was chosen to run graphical 3D animations \cite{Dirksen2015}.
This is a high level library for computer graphics, 
which takes advantage from WebGL implementation in modern web browsers.
The WebGL specification \cite{Matsuda2013} uses the computer Graphical Processor Unit (GPU) natively, 
that allows to build applications which needs good performance to generate animations and graphics.

		(c) The selected controller process the event;
		(d) If it is necessary to execute some action, as request more data, the controller

		which returns a JSON object;
		(f) The controller updates the model, variables used by the framework to show data at screen,
		and signals to the AngularJS framework to update the screen.

	}
	\label{rest_web_api_components}
\end{figure*}

Fig. \ref{web_components} shows the interaction between  main components in web application layer.
It can be observed that this is only a logic representation.
When a user interacts with the application in the web browser, it produces events detected by the 
AngularJS framework. The interaction may be a button click event, a mouse over event, a drag event or
other. So, the framework selects a controller component to process the event.
Controllers are components developed to the application, these are responsible to coordinate
data access to the model and to update the view. 

AngularJS applications use a famous design pattern called Model-View-Controller \cite{Fowler2002}. 
In practice, this means that controllers update the application state, so the AngularJS framework
should update the screen to users.
If new data or business logic execution are relevant, the controller request to a facade component
that communicate with the backend. 
Facade is a design pattern which hides complex logic required to perform some action \cite{Fowler2002}. 
Iin this case is the communication over HTTP protocol to the backend.
After the backend receives the request, it process and sends a HTTP response with a JSON object inside.
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) are a specification to represent and exchange data.

\subsubsection{REST Web API Layer}
\label{rest_web_api_layer}

This layer is responsible to execute business logic, for example,
calculate angles, extract data   from QTM software, among others.
The layer was implemented using the architectural style Representational State Transfer (REST) 
\cite{Grinberg2014}.
The main advantage of this technology is the high decoupling with the web application layer.
This decoupling promotes concepts separation between these layers, improving development process
and application maintainability.
To implement the REST style, was chosen the framework Flask \cite{Maia2015}.
Flask is implemented in Python language, it is known by minimalist philosophy 
that allows to create a simple project, which evolves into more complex models, according with
requisites at moment.

Fig. \ref{rest_web_api_components} shows the interaction between  main components in REST web API layer.
This representation is only a logic view.
After a user interacts with web application run at web browser and an action from the REST web API is
needed, a HTTP request is sent to the webserver. This is a REST style request.
The webserver receives the request and verify it. If, this request to the web API is  yes, the
request is dispatched to the web API implementation, that is written by the framework Flask.
The framework Flask identifies the request and selects the appropriate handling function. 
This function is written in Python language. 
The request handling function may access many libraries, like NumPy for number crunching,
Matplotlib for generate scientific graphics that are be sent to the user. 
Business logic application specific libraries may also be used, like libraries to calculate
cinematic information;
The PyMongo is an important library that may be used by the handling function as well.
This component will access the document base manager MongoDB (Section \ref{document_base_layer}),
so is possible manipulate and persist the application data.
The request handling also implements business logic, but is advised to implement complex logic in a specific
library.
When entire processing is done, a response is generated as a JSON object and sent back to 
the web application that runs at the user browser.
\subsubsection{Document Base Layer}
\label{document_base_layer}

The data persistence and basic manipulation is done by the document base layer.
This layer comprises a server running the document base manager MongoDB 
\cite{Plugge2014}, \cite{Plugge2014}.
This technology was chosen instead of a relational database management system, 
because the multidimensional data scope of the application is easily  modeled with
a document base. Also MongoDB is more easily scalable than a relational dabase management system.
MongoDB does not use tables like relational databases, it uses the collection concept.
A collection is a set of objects. Objects of a collection may have different structures
or types, although this is a bad practice. A MongoDB database can have multiple collections.
Objects are expressed using de BSON notation, which are very similar to JSON.

The Fig. \ref{mongo_oga} shows the application data base.
It have two data collections: patients and positionals\_data.
The patients collections have basic data from the patient.
The positionals\_data collection has spatial and markers 
data imported from a QTM/MATLAB file.
\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{./mongo_oga.eps}
	\caption{Application document base. The data base name is "oga". 
	This database has two collections: patients and positionals\_data. 
	}
	\label{mongo_oga}
\end{figure}


\section{Results}

The developed software allows to register patients.
After the patient is registered, the user may include gait samples to this patient.
This sample is imported to the software from a MATLAB file generated by the QTM software.
After the file is imported the screen described in Fig. \ref{qtm_data} is shown.
From this screen is possible to run a 3D animation including the markers acquired (Fig. \ref{animation}).
There is possible accelerate or slowdown the animation, to apply zoom in or zoom out, to controller pan
and to see a specific frame in the animation.
It is am important feature to see a frame because may be used to visualize the initial contact
and terminal swing frames. 
So, it is possible to update these fields in the screen shown at Fig. \ref{qtm_data}(c).
These data fields must be correctly filled otherwise the graphics will be incorrect.


The software has an option to name markers. After a marker is named, a graphic showing the 
marker's spatial progression will be plotted (Fig. \ref{spatial_progression}). 
Another important feature is the angle registering tool (Fig.~\ref{angles_tool}). 
After an angle is registered (Fig.~\ref{angles}), angular velocities (Fig.~\ref{av}) 
and angular accelerations (Fig.~\ref{aa}) will be plotted.

Another advantage of AngularJS and Material-Angular is the seamless adaptation of their components to samall screens. This characteristic turns possiblie with little efort to adapt the application to mobile phones.
The Fig. \ref{iphone} shows the application running in a mobile phone.

\section{Discussion}

A software for gait analysis fully available at web is a innovation in the field.
The bigger advantage is the easy access to the software,
because after the application is implanted in an internet webserver, 
a user with a recent HTML5 browser can use the application, independent from
the location.

Another theme that raises from this project is the creation of a centralized 
base, with data collected around world. Such endeavor would be priceless
to gait analysis researchers. This would require a more profound care with 
information security.

The software is available as free software. The intention is to attract
developers and health professionals to contribute and to use the software.

As future works, new data acquisition methods should be implemented, as plate force, electromyography (EMG)
and inertial measurement unit (IMU). 
The inclusion of automatic detection events at gait cycle could be a plus, for example,
detect the initial contact and terminal swing.
Furthermore, a simulation module is being developed. 
It will support machine learning methods to regression and classification.


\section{Conclusion}
This paper presented a gait analysis SaaS. It source code is available as free software 
under the MIT license \cite{MIT2015} at the web address <http://github.com/rob-nn/open\_gait\_analytics>.

The software offers data importation from the third party software QTM from Qualisys.
These data are about surface markers fixed in a patient body.
The software allows name markers, plot a spatial progression from it.
Also is possible to register angles and show graphics with angular velocities and angular accelerations.
The markers may be viewed by 3D animation.
All graphics are displayed according to the gait cycle phases.

The software will continue receive more features, and gradually will be available for more users.
It is possible to other people implant or use the software as they wish.
