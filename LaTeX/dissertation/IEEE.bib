abstract = {This paper analyzes human motion, more specifically the human gait in the sagittal plane. A video camera is used to acquire images of a walking person, fitted with a set of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The acquired trajectories of the light points are then used to specify joint trajectories in a biped robot. To analyze the stability of the human gait, a system was also developed to acquire the center of pressure (CoP). This system uses eight force sensors, four under each foot. The influence of the human torso angle on the CoP position during walking was confirmed. Some experiments were carried out on a biped robot, and the results show that the acquired human gait can be used in a biped robot, after scale conversion.},

@article{Baker2007,
abstract = {Aristotle (384-322 BCE) can be attributed with the earliest recorded comments regarding the manner in which humans walk. It was not until the renaissance that further progress was made through the experiments and theorising of Giovanni Borelli (1608-1679). Although several scientists wrote about walking through the enlightenment period it was the brothers Willhelm (1804-1891) and Eduard (1806-1871) Weber, working in Leipzig who made the next major contribution based on very simple measurements. Both Jules Etienne Marey (1830-1904), working in France, and Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904), working in America, made significant advances in measurement technology. These were developed further by Otto Fischer (1861-1917) in collaboration with Willhelm Braune (1831-1892). The major developments in the early twentieth century were in the development of force plates and the understanding of kinetics. The team headed by Verne Inman (1905-1980) and Howard Eberhart (1906-1993) made major advances in America shortly after the Second War. David Sutherland (1923-2006) and Jacquelin Perry pioneered clinical applications in America and Jurg Baumann (1926-2000) in Europe. It was not until the advent of modern computers that clinical gait analysis became widely available. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = { Gait laboratories are generally used for helping in pathology diagnosis, verifying the efficiency of rehabilitation treatments and evaluating athlete's performance among other applications. One of the software packages commonly used for this purpose is motion analysis, comprised mainly of one software for data acquisition called Eva Hires, combined with force plates, video cameras and electromyography and one other software for data analysis, Ortho Trak or Kin Trak, which shows the 3D trajectories and torques resultant from the gait session. This paper describes part of a research involving these softwares, comparing the results obtained by Ortho Trak and Kin Trak for the same set of acquired data.},
