abstract = {This study investigated the full-body strategies utilized during a sit-to-stand (STS) task in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and the association between STS alterations and clinical measurements. Twenty-five patients with advanced knee OA and twenty healthy elderly adults were recruited to participate in this study. Patients were asked to stand up from a chair four times without using their arms. A 3D motion analysis system was used to capture the full-body kinematics during the task. Two force plates were used to capture the forces under each leg. The following parameters were investigated in the knee OA group and compared with the control group: the time to realize STS, the force ratio between both limbs, the knee and hip kinetics and the trunk kinematics. The pain and functional capacity were obtained from the WOMAC. The results showed that patients with knee OA put 10\% additional weight on the contralateral side when compared with the symmetrical strategy of the control group. Patients with knee OA showed a significantly lower knee flexion moment (0.51 Nm/kg vs. 0.72 Nm/kg), a higher maximal trunk flexion (46.4° vs. 37.5°), and a higher lateral trunk lean on the contralateral side (2.4° vs. 0.9°) when compared with the control group. The main correlations were found between pain and the averaged time to complete the STS task (r=0.55). With the quantification of the full-body mechanisms utilized during the STS task, which includes both distal and proximal compensations, our study brings new insights, leading to a better understanding of the functional alterations in patients with advanced knee OA.},

abstract = {Transitional movements are a determinant of functional independence and have limited study in amputees. Microprocessor prosthetic knees' abilities to assist transfemoral amputees with sitting and standing have not been studied. Through cross-sectional study, 21 transfemoral amputees, divided into 3 groups of 7 by knee type (power knee, C-leg, Mauch SNS) and 7 non-amputee controls (n=28) performed sit to stand and stand to sit while kinematic and kinetic data were recorded. Transfemoral amputees can stand (1.6-2.0s) and sit (2.1-2.8s) at rates comparable to controls (1.6s). Controls' ground reaction force (GRF) and knee moment production was <7\% asymmetric and superior to amputees' during both movements. For sit to stand, amputees' asymmetry for GRF ranged from 53 to 69\% and 110 to 124\% for knee moments. For stand to sit, amputees' asymmetry for GRF ranged from 32 to 60\% and 84 to 114\% for knee moments. Hip moment asymmetry for sit to stand was less for control (21\%) and power knee (34\%) groups than that produced by the Mauch SNS (59\%) group. For stand to sit, hip moment production for the Mauch SNS (47\%) and C-leg groups (71\%) were more asymmetric than controls (19\%). In the majority of cases transfemoral amputees do not load their prosthesis extensively for standing up or sitting down. Therefore, this transitional movement is currently a one-legged task, which increases stress on the sound limb. Generally, the prosthetic knees studied did not produce a significant knee moment in either task. Although most differences between knee groups were not statistically significant, differences may be clinically meaningful on an individual basis.},

@article{Kark2012,
abstract = {Gait summary measures have been developed as a convenient method to communicate overall gait pathology. These measures are primarily used in the context of paediatric cerebral palsy and their use remains largely untested in other disability groups. This study assessed the suitability of gait summary measures for use with lower limb amputees. Modified (m) versions of three published gait summary measures were investigated - the Gillette Gait Index (mGGI), the Gait Deviation Index (mGDI) and the Gait Profile Score (mGPS) in conjunction with the Movement Analysis Profile (MAP). Twenty unilateral lower limb amputees underwent three-dimensional gait analysis. All measures reported significant differences between levels of amputation on the prosthetic limb. The mGGI and mGPS detected significant differences between the levels of amputation on the intact side, but the mGDI did not. All gait summary measures were moderately to strongly correlated with leg-length normalised self-selected walking speed and strong correlations were reported between all measures. The MAP exposed common strategies in amputee gait and showed that sagittal hip and knee kinematics contributed predominantly to overall gait deviation in this population group. The mGGI, mGDI and mGPS identified, quantified and stratified gait pathology, indicating that any of the gait measures investigated in this study can be applied as outcome measures in research and case management in lower limb amputees.},

@article{Leurs2012,
abstract = {In order to achieve efficacious walking, transfemoral amputees must adapt coordination within both the artificial and the sound lower limb. We analyzed kinematic strategies in amputees using the planar covariation of lower limb segments approach. When the elevation angles of the thigh, shank and foot are plotted one versus the others, they describe a regular loop which lies close to a plane in normal adults' gait. Orientation of this plane changes with increased speed, in relation to mechanical energetic saving. We used an opto-electronic device to record the elevation angles of both limbs' segments of novice and expert transfemoral amputees and compared them to those of control subjects. The statistical structure underlying the distribution of these angles was described by principal component analysis and Fourier transform. The typical elliptic loop was preserved in prosthetic walking, in both limbs in both novice and expert transfemoral amputees. This reflects a specific control over the thigh elevation angle taking into account knowledge of the other elevation angles throughout the gait cycle. The best-fitting plane of faster trials rotates around the long axis of the gait loop with respect to the plane of slower trials for control subjects, and even more for the sound limb of expert amputees. In contrast, plane rotation is very weak or absent for the prosthetic limb. We suggest that these results reveal a centrally commanded compensation strategy.},

abstract = {A prerequisite for well-posedness of parameter estimation of biological and physiological systems is a priori global identifiability, a property which concerns uniqueness of the solution for the unknown model parameters. Assessing a priori global identifiability is particularly difficult for nonlinear dynamic models. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature but no solution exists in the general case. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for testing global identifiability of nonlinear dynamic models, based on differential algebra. The characteristic set associated to the dynamic equations is calculated in an efficient way and computer algebra techniques are used to solve the resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The algorithm is capable of handling many features arising in biological system models, including zero initial conditions and time-varying parameters. Examples of usage of the algorithm for analyzing a priori global identifiability of nonlinear models of biological and physiological systems are presented.},

@article{Yeung2012,
abstract = {Trans-tibial amputees are advised to walk as much as able people to achieve healthy and independent life. However, they usually have difficulties in doing so. Previous researches only included data from a few steps when studying the gait of amputees. Walking over a long distance was rarely examined. The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in spatial-temporal, kinetic and kinematic gait parameters of trans-tibial amputees after long-distance walking. Six male unilateral trans-tibial amputees performed two sessions of 30-min walking on a level treadmill at their self-selected comfortable speed. Gait analysis was undertaken over-ground: (1) before walking, (2) after the 1st walking session and (3) after the 2nd walking session. After the long-distance walking, changes in spatial-temporal gait parameters were small and insignificant. However, the sound side ankle rocker progression and push-off were significantly reduced. This was due to the fatigue of the sound side plantar flexors and was compensated by the greater effort in the prosthetic side. The prosthetic side knee joint showed significantly increased flexion and moment during loading response to facilitate the anterior rotation of the prosthetic shank. The prosthetic side hip extensors also provided more power at terminal stance to facilitate propulsion. Endurance training of the sound side plantar flexors, and improvements in the prosthetic design to assist anterior rotation of the prosthetic shank should improve long-distance walking in trans-tibial amputees.},

abstract = {The prosthetic foot plays an important role in propelling, breaking, balancing and supporting body loads while the amputee ambulates on different grounds. It is therefore important to quantify the effect of the prosthetic foot mechanism on biomechanical parameters, in order to prevent pressure ulcers and deep tissue injury. Our aim was to monitor the internal stresses in the residuum of transtibial amputation (TTA) prosthetic-users ambulating on different terrains, which the amputees encounter during their daily activities, i.e. paved floor, grass, ascending and descending stairs and slope. We specifically aimed to compare between the internal stresses in the TTA residuum of amputees ambulating with a novel hydraulic prosthetic foot compared to conventional energy storage and return (ESR) prosthetic feet. Monitoring of internal stresses was accomplished using a portable subject-specific real-time internal stress monitor. We found significant decrease (p<0.01) in peak internal stresses and in the loading rate of the amputated limb, while walking with the hydraulic foot, compared to walking with ESR feet. The loading rate calculated while ambulating with the hydraulic foot was at least three times lower than the loading rate calculated while ambulating with the ESR foot. Although the average decrease in internal stresses was ≈ 2-fold larger when replacing single-toe ESR feet with the hydraulic foot than when replacing split-toed ESR feet with the hydraulic foot, the differences were statistically insignificant. Our findings suggest that using a hydraulic prosthetic foot may protect the distal tibial end of the TTA residuum from high stresses, therefore preventing pressure-related injury and pain.},
