This work has as objective a software as a service implementation, for human gait analysis and simulation, based in a layered architectural model. The software great advantage is his availability at web and in mobile devices. Furthermore a data base with human gait data will be generated. The software has a simulation module, that will take advantage from this base, this will benefit researchers from all the world. This project is only a beginning from a thing much more greater, but movement analysis based at spacial data, recovered from a motion capture software, is already possible. It is possible too, make simulations using the neural artificial network CMAC.
