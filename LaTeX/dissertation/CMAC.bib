@article{Kara2000a,
abstract = {Vision has extensively expanded robots' capabilities, making the
robot control problem more complex. To track a target with a robot arm
in a three-dimensional space involves the use of precise commands. We
propose to insert a hierarchical neurocontroller based on CMAC
(cerebellar model articulation controller) networks in a visual servoing
loop. This hierarchical structure splits the robot's workspace and
assigns different CMAC controllers imposing thus a specialized region
CMAC. Compared to a single CMAC with the same number of weights, the
neurocontroller's sensitivity and precision is increased. Robot
positioning and target tracking with visual feedback can then be done
with a better precision},

@article{Yeh2010a,
abstract = {A cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) control system, which contains only one single-input controller implemented by a differentiable CMAC, is proposed in this paper. In the proposed scheme, the CMAC controller is solely used to control the plant, and no conventional controller is needed. Without a preliminary offline learning, the single-input CMAC controller can provide the control effort to the plant at each online learning step. To train the differentiable CMAC online, the gradient descent algorithm is employed to derive the learning rules. The sensitivity of the plant, with respect to the input, is approximated by a simple formula so that the learning rules can be applied to unknown plants. Moreover, based on a discrete-type Lyapunov function, conditions on the learning rates guaranteeing the convergence of the output error are derived in this paper. Finally, simulations on controlling three different plants are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

@article{Kim2000,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the application of quadratic
optimization for motion control to feedback control of robotic systems
using cerebellar model arithmetic computer (CMAC) neural networks.
Explicit solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (H-J-B) equation for
optimal control of robotic systems are found by solving an algebraic
Riccati equation. It is shown how the CMAC can cope with nonlinearities
through optimization with no preliminary off-line learning phase
required. The adaptive-learning algorithm is derived from Lyapunov
stability analysis, so that both system-tracking stability and error
convergence can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system. The
filtered-tracking error or critic gain and the Lyapunov function for the
nonlinear analysis are derived from the user input in terms of a
specified quadratic-performance index. Simulation results from a
two-link robot manipulator show the satisfactory performance of the
proposed control schemes even in the presence of large modeling
uncertainties and external disturbances},

abstract = {A nonlinear proportional-derivative controller plus adaptive neuronal network compensation is proposed. With the aim of estimating the desired torque, a two-layer neural network is used. Then, adaptation laws for the neural network weights are derived. Asymptotic convergence of the position and velocity tracking errors is proven, while the neural network weights are shown to be uniformly bounded. The proposed scheme has been experimentally validated in real time. These experimental evaluations were carried in two different mechanical systems: a horizontal two degrees-of-freedom robot and a vertical one degree-of-freedom arm which is affected by the gravitational force. In each one of the two experimental set-ups, the proposed scheme was implemented without and with adaptive neural network compensation. Experimental results confirmed the tracking accuracy of the proposed adaptive neural network-based controller.},

@article{Lane1992,
abstract = {The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network is capable of learning nonlinear functions extremely quickly due to the local nature of its weight updating. The rectangular shape of CMAC receptive field functions, however, produces discontinuous (staircase) function approximations without inherent analytical derivatives. The ability to learn both functions and function derivatives is important for the development of many online adaptive filter, estimation, and control algorithms. It is shown that use of B-spline receptive field functions in conjunction with more general CMAC weight addressing schemes allows higher-order CMAC neural networks to be developed that can learn both functions and function derivatives. This also allows hierarchical and multilayer CMAC network architectures to be constructed that can be trained using standard error back-propagation learning techniques.},

@article{Teddy2007,
abstract = {The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network (NN) is a well-established computational model of the human cerebellum. Nevertheless, there are two major drawbacks associated with the uniform quantization scheme of the CMAC network. They are the following: (1) a constant output resolution associated with the entire input space and (2) the generalization-accuracy dilemma. Moreover, the size of the CMAC network is an exponential function of the number of inputs. Depending on the characteristics of the training data, only a small percentage of the entire set of CMAC memory cells is utilized. Therefore, the efficient utilization of the CMAC memory is a crucial issue. One approach is to quantize the input space nonuniformly. For existing nonuniformly quantized CMAC systems, there is a tradeoff between memory efficiency and computational complexity. Inspired by the underlying organizational mechanism of the human brain, this paper presents a novel CMAC architecture named hierarchically clustered adaptive quantization CMAC (HCAQ-CMAC). HCAQ-CMAC employs hierarchical clustering for the nonuniform quantization of the input space to identify significant input segments and subsequently allocating more memory cells to these regions. The stability of the HCAQ-CMAC network is theoretically guaranteed by the proof of its learning convergence. The performance of the proposed network is subsequently benchmarked against the original CMAC network, as well as two other existing CMAC variants on two real-life applications, namely, automated control of car maneuver and modeling of the human blood glucose dynamics. The experimental results have demonstrated that the HCAQ-CMAC network offers an efficient memory allocation scheme and improves the generalization and accuracy of the network output to achieve better or comparable performances with smaller memory usages.

@article{Chao2013a,
abstract = {This study proposes an islanding detection method for photovoltaic power generation systems based on a cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network. First, islanding phenomenon test data were used as training samples to train the CMAC neural network. Then, a photovoltaic power generation system was tested with the islanding phenomena. Because the CMAC neural network possesses association and induction abilities and characteristics that activate similar input signals in approximate memory during training process, the CMAC only requires that the weight values of the excited memory addresses be adjusted, thereby reducing the training time. Furthermore, quantification of the input signals enhanced the detection tolerance of the proposed method. Finally, the simulative and experimental data verified the feasibility of adopting the proposed detection method for islanding phenomena.},
