abstract = {Gait analysis studies involve continuous curves of data measured over a gait cycle. Curve analysis and interpretation require adequate statistical methods. Three principal problems may be encountered in clinical practice: (i) the reliability of gait curves for a given patient, (ii) classifying a new subject as belonging to a given population or not and (iii) comparison of two populations (independent or paired). This paper presents three statistical tools for solving these problems: (i) intra-class correlation coefficients, (ii) confidence bands for a population (iii) a combination of analysis of variance and confidence bands for the difference between the means and shows how they can be used in clinical practice.

abstract = {The Microsoft Kinect sensor has gained attention as a tool for gait analysis for several years. Despite the many advantages the sensor provides, however, the lack of a native capability to extract joints from the side view of a human body still limits the adoption of the device to a number of relevant applications. This paper presents an algorithm to locate and estimate the trajectories of up to six joints extracted from the side depth view of a human body captured by the Kinect device. The algorithm is then applied to extract data that can be exploited to provide an objective score for the ``Get Up and Go Test'', which is typically adopted for gait analysis in rehabilitation fields. Starting from the depth-data stream provided by the Microsoft Kinect sensor, the proposed algorithm relies on anthropometric models only, to locate and identify the positions of the joints. Differently from machine learning approaches, this solution avoids complex computations, which usually require significant resources. The reliability of the information about the joint position output by the algorithm is evaluated by comparison to a marker-based system. Tests show that the trajectories extracted by the proposed algorithm adhere to the reference curves better than the ones obtained from the skeleton generated by the native applications provided within the Microsoft Kinect (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA, 2013) and OpenNI (OpenNI organization, Tel Aviv, Israel, 2013) Software Development Kits.},

@article{Ghoussayni2004,
abstract = {A simple and rapid automatic method for detection of gait events at the foot could speed up and possibly increase the repeatability of gait analysis and evaluations of treatments for pathological gaits. The aim of this study was to compare and validate a kinematic-based algorithm used in the detection of four gait events, heel contact, heel rise, toe contact and toe off. Force platform data is often used to obtain start and end of contact phases, but not usually heel rise and toe contact events. For this purpose synchronised kinematic, kinetic and video data were captured from 12 healthy adult subjects walking both barefoot and shod at slow and normal self-selected speeds. The data were used to determine the gait events using three methods: force, visual inspection and algorithm methods. Ninety percent of all timings given by the algorithm were within one frame (16.7ms) when compared to visual inspection. There were no statistically significant differences between the visual and algorithm timings. For both heel and toe contact the differences between the three methods were within 1.5 frames, whereas for heel rise and toe off the differences between the force on one side and the visual and algorithm on the other were higher and more varied (up to 175ms). In addition, the algorithm method provided the duration of three intervals, heel contact to toe contact, toe contact to heel rise and heel rise to toe off, which are not readily available from force platform data. The ability to automatically and reliably detect the timings of these four gait events and three intervals using kinematic data alone is an asset to clinical gait analysis. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = { Gait laboratories are generally used for helping in pathology diagnosis, verifying the efficiency of rehabilitation treatments and evaluating athlete's performance among other applications. One of the software packages commonly used for this purpose is motion analysis, comprised mainly of one software for data acquisition called Eva Hires, combined with force plates, video cameras and electromyography and one other software for data analysis, Ortho Trak or Kin Trak, which shows the 3D trajectories and torques resultant from the gait session. This paper describes part of a research involving these softwares, comparing the results obtained by Ortho Trak and Kin Trak for the same set of acquired data.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes human motion, more specifically the human gait in the sagittal plane. A video camera is used to acquire images of a walking person, fitted with a set of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The acquired trajectories of the light points are then used to specify joint trajectories in a biped robot. To analyze the stability of the human gait, a system was also developed to acquire the center of pressure (CoP). This system uses eight force sensors, four under each foot. The influence of the human torso angle on the CoP position during walking was confirmed. Some experiments were carried out on a biped robot, and the results show that the acquired human gait can be used in a biped robot, after scale conversion.},

@article{Moreno2009,
abstract = {There are several pathological conditions that modify the gait pattern in the infant population, in order to evaluate this pattern it is necessary to compare it to parameters studied in ldquonormalrdquo individuals, clinically healthy. For this reason, it results necessary to count with normal parameters specific for this kind of population. However, the studies that are in the literature about the pediatric gait development do not provide enough information to perform evaluations where comparisons with healthy individuals are necessary. The objective of this study was to obtain a data base of the spatio-temporal gait parameters of pediatric healthy Mexican subjects, providing new information about this kind of gait, thus this information can subsequently be included in different motion analysis softwares. With this purpose, a descriptive study analyzed the gait of 120 children (61 boys and 59 girls) between the ages of 6 and 13, analyzing how the age affects the spatio-temporal gait parameters. Significant differences were noted with the age in the great majority of the spatio-temporal gait parameters. In addition, significant differences were found from those reported in the literature for normal adult gait.},

@article{Beynon2010,
abstract = {The Gait Profile Score (GPS) is a single index measure that summarises the overall deviation of kinematic gait data relative to normative data. The GPS can be decomposed to provide Gait Variable Scores (GVS) of nine key component kinematic gait variables, which are presented as a Movement Analysis Profile (MAP). The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of the GPS and MAP relative to clinician judgments.Kinematic data were selected from 60 children and inspected by 17 experienced clinicians. The degree of abnormality of the overall unilateral gait pattern and the nine kinematic variables was rated according to a 0-10 point scale.Strong, significant, positive correlations were found between the GPS and MAP component scores, and clinicians' ratings of kinematic gait deviation, with Spearman correlations ranging from 0.84 to 0.97. These high correlations provide evidence that the GPS and the MAP have criterion-related validity relative to clinician judgments. We propose that the GPS and particularly its MAP decomposition may be useful in clinical practice and education as an adjunct to the traditional presentation of complex kinematic data. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},
