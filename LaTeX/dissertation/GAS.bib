abstract = { Gait laboratories are generally used for helping in pathology diagnosis, verifying the efficiency of rehabilitation treatments and evaluating athlete's performance among other applications. One of the software packages commonly used for this purpose is motion analysis, comprised mainly of one software for data acquisition called Eva Hires, combined with force plates, video cameras and electromyography and one other software for data analysis, Ortho Trak or Kin Trak, which shows the 3D trajectories and torques resultant from the gait session. This paper describes part of a research involving these softwares, comparing the results obtained by Ortho Trak and Kin Trak for the same set of acquired data.},

abstract = {A simple and rapid automatic method for detection of gait events at the foot could speed up and possibly increase the repeatability of gait analysis and evaluations of treatments for pathological gaits. The aim of this study was to compare and validate a kinematic-based algorithm used in the detection of four gait events, heel contact, heel rise, toe contact and toe off. Force platform data is often used to obtain start and end of contact phases, but not usually heel rise and toe contact events. For this purpose synchronised kinematic, kinetic and video data were captured from 12 healthy adult subjects walking both barefoot and shod at slow and normal self-selected speeds. The data were used to determine the gait events using three methods: force, visual inspection and algorithm methods. Ninety percent of all timings given by the algorithm were within one frame (16.7ms) when compared to visual inspection. There were no statistically significant differences between the visual and algorithm timings. For both heel and toe contact the differences between the three methods were within 1.5 frames, whereas for heel rise and toe off the differences between the force on one side and the visual and algorithm on the other were higher and more varied (up to 175ms). In addition, the algorithm method provided the duration of three intervals, heel contact to toe contact, toe contact to heel rise and heel rise to toe off, which are not readily available from force platform data. The ability to automatically and reliably detect the timings of these four gait events and three intervals using kinematic data alone is an asset to clinical gait analysis. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Microsoft Kinect sensor has gained attention as a tool for gait analysis for several years. Despite the many advantages the sensor provides, however, the lack of a native capability to extract joints from the side view of a human body still limits the adoption of the device to a number of relevant applications. This paper presents an algorithm to locate and estimate the trajectories of up to six joints extracted from the side depth view of a human body captured by the Kinect device. The algorithm is then applied to extract data that can be exploited to provide an objective score for the ``Get Up and Go Test'', which is typically adopted for gait analysis in rehabilitation fields. Starting from the depth-data stream provided by the Microsoft Kinect sensor, the proposed algorithm relies on anthropometric models only, to locate and identify the positions of the joints. Differently from machine learning approaches, this solution avoids complex computations, which usually require significant resources. The reliability of the information about the joint position output by the algorithm is evaluated by comparison to a marker-based system. Tests show that the trajectories extracted by the proposed algorithm adhere to the reference curves better than the ones obtained from the skeleton generated by the native applications provided within the Microsoft Kinect (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA, 2013) and OpenNI (OpenNI organization, Tel Aviv, Israel, 2013) Software Development Kits.},

@article{Beynon2010,
abstract = {The Gait Profile Score (GPS) is a single index measure that summarises the overall deviation of kinematic gait data relative to normative data. The GPS can be decomposed to provide Gait Variable Scores (GVS) of nine key component kinematic gait variables, which are presented as a Movement Analysis Profile (MAP). The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of the GPS and MAP relative to clinician judgments.Kinematic data were selected from 60 children and inspected by 17 experienced clinicians. The degree of abnormality of the overall unilateral gait pattern and the nine kinematic variables was rated according to a 0-10 point scale.Strong, significant, positive correlations were found between the GPS and MAP component scores, and clinicians' ratings of kinematic gait deviation, with Spearman correlations ranging from 0.84 to 0.97. These high correlations provide evidence that the GPS and the MAP have criterion-related validity relative to clinician judgments. We propose that the GPS and particularly its MAP decomposition may be useful in clinical practice and education as an adjunct to the traditional presentation of complex kinematic data. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Moreno2009,
abstract = {There are several pathological conditions that modify the gait pattern in the infant population, in order to evaluate this pattern it is necessary to compare it to parameters studied in ldquonormalrdquo individuals, clinically healthy. For this reason, it results necessary to count with normal parameters specific for this kind of population. However, the studies that are in the literature about the pediatric gait development do not provide enough information to perform evaluations where comparisons with healthy individuals are necessary. The objective of this study was to obtain a data base of the spatio-temporal gait parameters of pediatric healthy Mexican subjects, providing new information about this kind of gait, thus this information can subsequently be included in different motion analysis softwares. With this purpose, a descriptive study analyzed the gait of 120 children (61 boys and 59 girls) between the ages of 6 and 13, analyzing how the age affects the spatio-temporal gait parameters. Significant differences were noted with the age in the great majority of the spatio-temporal gait parameters. In addition, significant differences were found from those reported in the literature for normal adult gait.},

A video camera is used to acquire images of a walking person, fitted with a set of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The acquired trajectories of the light points are then used to specify joint trajectories in a biped robot. To analyze the stability of the human gait, a system was also developed to acquire the center of pressure (CoP). This system uses eight force sensors, four under each foot. The influence of the human torso angle on the CoP position during walking was confirmed. Some experiments were carried out on a biped robot, and the results show that the acquired human gait can be used in a biped robot, after scale conversion.},

Nevertheless, software development in an academic setting is often unsystematic, which can lead to problems associated with maintenance and long-term availibility. Unfortunately, well-documented software development methodology is difficult to adopt, and technical measures that directly improve bioinformatic programming have not been described comprehensively. We have examined 22 software projects and have identified a set of practices for software development in an academic environment. We found them useful to plan a project, support the involvement of experts (e.g. experimentalists), and to promote higher quality and maintainability of the resulting programs. This article describes 12 techniques that facilitate a quick start into software engineering. We describe 3 of the 22 projects in detail and give many examples to illustrate the usage of particular techniques. We expect this toolbox to be useful for many bioinformatics programming projects and to the training of scientific programmers.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},
