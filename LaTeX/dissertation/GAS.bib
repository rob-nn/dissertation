abstract = {There are several pathological conditions that modify the gait pattern in the infant population, in order to evaluate this pattern it is necessary to compare it to parameters studied in ldquonormalrdquo individuals, clinically healthy. For this reason, it results necessary to count with normal parameters specific for this kind of population. However, the studies that are in the literature about the pediatric gait development do not provide enough information to perform evaluations where comparisons with healthy individuals are necessary. The objective of this study was to obtain a data base of the spatio-temporal gait parameters of pediatric healthy Mexican subjects, providing new information about this kind of gait, thus this information can subsequently be included in different motion analysis softwares. With this purpose, a descriptive study analyzed the gait of 120 children (61 boys and 59 girls) between the ages of 6 and 13, analyzing how the age affects the spatio-temporal gait parameters. Significant differences were noted with the age in the great majority of the spatio-temporal gait parameters. In addition, significant differences were found from those reported in the literature for normal adult gait.},

abstract = { Gait laboratories are generally used for helping in pathology diagnosis, verifying the efficiency of rehabilitation treatments and evaluating athlete's performance among other applications. One of the software packages commonly used for this purpose is motion analysis, comprised mainly of one software for data acquisition called Eva Hires, combined with force plates, video cameras and electromyography and one other software for data analysis, Ortho Trak or Kin Trak, which shows the 3D trajectories and torques resultant from the gait session. This paper describes part of a research involving these softwares, comparing the results obtained by Ortho Trak and Kin Trak for the same set of acquired data.},

@article{Duhamel2004,
abstract = {Gait analysis studies involve continuous curves of data measured over a gait cycle. Curve analysis and interpretation require adequate statistical methods. Three principal problems may be encountered in clinical practice: (i) the reliability of gait curves for a given patient, (ii) classifying a new subject as belonging to a given population or not and (iii) comparison of two populations (independent or paired). This paper presents three statistical tools for solving these problems: (i) intra-class correlation coefficients, (ii) confidence bands for a population (iii) a combination of analysis of variance and confidence bands for the difference between the means and shows how they can be used in clinical practice.
