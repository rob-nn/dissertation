This work has as objective a software as a service implementation, for human gait analysis and simulation, based in a layered architectural model. 
The software great advantage is his availability at web and mobile devices. 
With this possibility and the software use, a human gait data base creation will be possible.
The software has a simulation module, that will use this data base as data source.
Movement analysis based at spacial data, recovered from a motion capture software, was implemented and signals simulations using the artificial neural network CMAC, too.
The project is open source and new features will be often implemented.
